        "calling it now mel saved jayce using thus far unseen powers possibly on purpose but more likely automatically and without her realising i think her power protects people she deeply cares about which explains why viktor was hurt when jayce wasnt even though they were side by side same thing we see in ambessas blood sweat and tears cinematic trailer when the baby inside ambessa mel glows and suddenly ambessa is healed also right as jinxs rocket hit the council chamber we saw mels back glowing",

        "man caitlyn being crowned piltovers leader in a manner of speaking hit hard the shadow crown she gets in the intro is great foreshadowing erm forgive the pun im dreading her downfall and her unleashing the grey especially when her mother said she wanted the undercity to be able to breathe clean air was rough but they didnt go to such lengths to show her general goodness last season to have this be the end of her arc \n\ncaitlyns hitting vi was reminiscent of vi slapping powder in the first season that hurt\n\ni saw there are some arguments about caitlyn definitely making the shot even with the kiddo wrapped around jinx but remember their hextech malfunctioned for a lot of the fight definitely not a risk worth taking im  with vi on that decision\n\ni really dug jinx and sevika teaming up that was fun get jinxed playing on sevikas arm was perfect\n\nalso poor vi shes just doing her best to making the best of an awful situation but she keeps getting screwed over",
        "i cant believe cait and vi kissed then broke up ten minutes later\n\ni fucking love it looking forward to the eventual reconciliation hopefully",
        "theres so much to cover in this season with new and old ground other than maybe the beginning of episode  ive been super excited and happy with the pacing i do hope we get more time to breathe but it seems unlikely absolutely buzzing to see whats up with the hex gates the core being wild there was so out of left field and interesting to me\n\nim pretty confused about the whole black rose thing since i dont know a lot about lol geopolitics but im surprised were getting involved with the death of mels brother excited and intrigued\n\ni love cait this season even if im pissed at her utilizing the past byproduct of the undercitys destitution and oppression by piltover to poison and kill them is absolutely creatively vile watching her slowly begin to dehumanize the residents of the undercity on her path to vengeance is utterly brutal her blood is in your veins cait your class is showing her grief is driving her mad and it hurts to watch\n\nim really liking jayce this season which i didnt expect i wouldnt say i was a hater before but i definitely felt slighted by him being pushed into different positions he was severely under prepared for he was playing politician and fighter but i like him most as a scientist\n\nim so intrigued by viktors situation sky being fused with the hexcore makes me wonder if its somehow manipulating him or if shes truly in there helping him do good in the world its unnerving seeing him so unlike himself even if he seems at peace also w for huck being cured of addiction i was surprised and delighted to see him again\n\ni cried at the beginning of episode  during jinxs monologue and nearly again when she saw vi in that enforcer outfit my heart wrenches for her and im in love with her characterization it feels very strange for a child to take a liking to her it definitely seems like a mirror to silco caring for powder \n\noverall i loved several of the music choices the art is stunning you can definitely feel the studio trying to push boundaries and play with the tools of the style theyve gotten to know so well so excited to see more but im not ready for it to be over",
        "i can see why this took  million usd to make that was so cool",
        "the robo jesus scene with viktor was insane the imagery with the lighting and the people bowing to him is probably one of my favorite shots out of the series",
        "i feel like cait is gonna get a lot of unfair shit when really she is just like most other characters in this show badly coping with trauma and lashing out at people",
        "we got the kiss but at what cost",
        "overall i prefer season ones act  \n\nthe pacing here is a bit too scattershot and fast for my taste but im still really enjoying it episode two and three in particular stand out to me \n\nthe opening to episode two was masterfully done and episode threes fight scene might be the coolest fight ive ever seen in animation the music is on point and the animation is incredible\n\ni have heard professional reviewers who have already seen act  say that episode six and onwards feels more like season one arcane so maybe towards the end things will slow down and the plot will give the characters more time to breathe",
        "i went into this with an open mind after loving s so far it seems a little messy and the pacing is really fast too fast caits decision to flush out everyone by using the grey should have gotten way more attention i would have loved to see an actual discussion about doing that between her and vi im overall not a fan of each episode starting with a plot dump in music video form victor leaving was also rushed\n\nthe animation is insanely good of course im fine with the use of music however the lyrics are really on the nose sometimes\n\ni hope part  and  will slow down just a little bit",
        "im loving the show so far but i really hope it slows down a lot in act ii i dont think any of the story decisions have been explicitly bad but they need time to breathe specifically the character beats \n\nhow much more painful would the jayceviktor breakup have been if all of episode  they were together trying to make their new dynamic work but theyve just become too different and viktor newly numbed by the hexcore has to be the one to sever their bond \n\nthe last time heimerdinger saw jayce he voted him off the council after being his mentor for years sure there were more important things going on at the moment and there are  more episodes to come so im not too worried but i wish any lingering feelings of resentment between them would have been made more explicit \n\nmy biggest critique is definitely vi giving up on powder the last thing vi said to jinx in s was powder its okay after she had just killed silco and before that we got their are we still sisters nothing is ever going to change that but ten minutes later she changes her mind yes jinx blew up the capital building but jinx has already done so many terrible things to vi specifically that it feels odd that this would be the thing to push her over the edge and turn on powder \n\nmy assumption watching the trailers was that vi was just lying to cait in order to get on the mission so she could possibly save powder but that theory goes out the window as soon as vi allows caitlyn to take a kill shot at jinx sure it wasnt actually her but vi thought it was and that means something \n\ni just find it really odd that they open s with vi already having given up on powder and since at the end of s she was still in her corner that means she came to that conclusion offscreen we desperately needed to see what happened in vis mind between its okay powder and my sister is gone theres only jinx now maybe that could have been done in a scene where vi and cait discover cassandras body together and she witnesses jinxs destruction firsthand but shes already witnessed plenty of her violence so i dont know why it would change her mind now unequivocally i think the writers should have put off the severing of their bond at least to the end of episode three if not more \n\ni know the writers dont necessarily control how much time we have per episode and they wanted to make a show that was super fastpaced but that can only be sustained for so long the show is still enjoyable and i will be sat attentively for the next ones but i wish that these plot points could have been extended even a little bit",
        "oh my god the caitvi kiss im tweaking",
        "sevika coming in with crazy slots",
        "episode  was good but did anyone else feel like the pacing was way too fast the only time the episode even sort of tried to slow down was then scene with drunk vi",
        "quality of animation remains as visually stunning as last season if not better the animation during caitlyns mothers funeral sequence in particular was one of my favorite animated sequences in awhile",
        "it is still early truly but i agree with a lot of the pacing stuff i wasnt turned off per say by the music videostyle stuff we were getting but i found them jarring if effective for getting story beats across\n\ni hate to call this now but part of me thinks with how act  went maybe the show could have benefited from having a third season i know were all celebrating that its a two season show so it doesnt wear itself out but when the pacing is just so fast so far maybe letting the story stretch into a third season would be good\n\nagain its early i could be wrong\n\nedit inb act  of s could have been and should have been its own season each episode covering an entire arc rest of s is functionally s",
        "shouldnt heimerdinger and jayce be on worse terms when they met up to discuss ekkos diseased leaves like the only conflict in that scene was between ekko and jayce and nothing on the fact that jayce evicted heimerdinger out of the council",
        "ooooh i can already tell im gonna dislike ambessa medarda so much\n\nedit first name",
        "yep i knew ambessa would nominate caitlyn she knows that she can control her cait will be the leader only on papers",
        "whos the guy vi got drunk with he joined up the enforcers and then disapprovingly left when caitlyn accepted the role at the end but i feel like i dont know anything about why hes in the show",
        "maybe im easily impressed but i felt the pacing was pretty good i know a lot of people are saying the episodes are rushed but to me it didnt come off as such sure theres a lot of content happening in a short time but none of it felt rushed to me cus it made sense every major character is in their rising conflict caitlyn jayce viktor vi jinx and mel thats  major characters all reaching a major turning point in the story so of course the episodes content feels like a lot but it makes sense to me maybe some of it was intentional too to show how none of these characters get a moment to just breathe where caitlyn had to step up so much and jinx is on the run from everyone might be a stretch but mels also had to step up quite a bit since her city is in shambles and she has to play mind games with her mum too im not trynna say its worse or better than season  im just saying that i enjoyed watching act  and didnt even think about the pacing until i came to see what others thought i did wish it was longer i need more",
        "here are my emotions watching act \n\n the opening straight up  vibes\n\n when jayce saved victor with the hexcore i was like no he wanted you to destroy it\n\n i was actually crying during cassandras funeral the animation team absolutely knew how to illustrate the feeling of emptiness caitlyn was going through the way everything becomes blurry and colorless and all you are able to focus on is the person you lost augh\n\n i didnt care much about the memorium attack but it was nice watching vi and cait fighting together\n\n jinx giving silco a water funeral was actual art like they were floting through space\n\n sevika trying to unite the chembarons after silcos death felt like that one person in the group project doing all the work\n\n isha is cute i want to see more of her but im afraid she is not gonna make it jinx said it herself everybody she gets close to dies one way or another\n\n i had the biggest fcking grin on my face when sevika fought smeech with jinxs new arm while it played get jinxed and she was just like seriously\n\n i love how jinx has just accepted that shes basically the boogeyman everybody in piltover and zaun is scared shitless of her or wants to cut her head off and the way she just doesnt care at all is such a mood\n\n if it wasnt obious already jinx is a fcking genius rerouting all the ventilation shafts in zaun that the task force was using aginst them and setting up the color explosions and the temple for the showdown in what semed like days all by herself with only sevika and a literal child to help her\n\n caits descent int tyranny is so well done at first she still had compassion for the civilians and was aginst an invasion only angry at jinx telling her father she wants to tear jinxs laugh from her throat was cold but understandable calling zaunites animals was a shocker and even she admitted it shooting the wooden copy of jinx in the arcade was cause for concern arresting the accountant for life and almost shooting him aswell after he cooperated completely and using poisonous gas against civilians made it clear she doesnt care what she has to do to get to jinx and then shooting at a child sealed the deal she is not a monster not even at the end but every event every encounter is like a domino falling in her head pushing her to go a little further become a little more ruthless until you completely lose yourself in your own hatred so well executed\n\n my jaw was on the floor when victor had his jesus moment i would absolutely be one of his followers\n\n that kiss omg i was actually about to faint from exitement and yelled yes yes finally\n\n jayce ekko and heimerdinger at the foot of the hexgates gave me  a space odyssey vibes\n\n the fnal fight was absolutely brutal they were all genuently trying to kill each other and for a moment i thought one of them might actually die and te artstyle oh my god the artstyle\n\n jinx loosing her finger was horrifying i knew it would happen because of the posters but when cait took the shot i was paralysed and the way jinx looks at her hand and its just gone felt like something out of a horror movie\n\n jinx admitting to her sisters that she wants to die is something i never ever want to hear again youre perfect\n\n finally the breakup it thought i was ready for it i was not ready at all watching cait hit her leave her behind and vi whimper on the floor because she has lost absolutely everything and everyone again fcking broke me i wasnt even able to cry i was just feeling empty\n\n im addicted cant wait until next week for my next hit of depression",
        "i am kinda confused by all the disappointed comments i see zero drop in quality i was ecstatic all the way through the episodes",
        "im currently really struggling with season  i dont like how much is happening in such a short amount of time and i feel like all characters are acting ooc except maybe heimerdinger fair enough that everyone is traumatized and being rash but a lot of it comes off as nonchalance im not feeling investedimmersed at all the whole story up until now feels rushed i really hope everything ends up being tied together the animation though is wow",
        "one minor issue i had with season  continued here and that there were always characters that while minor recurred enough that it felt weird their names were glanced over or only said once like for the little troop of enforcers maddy directly gives her name but her partner and the big shield guy arent ever named even though they appear in all three episodes and isha the girl with jinx i only know her name because the subtitles gave her name not because she introduced herself or someone called her name",
        "i sorta wish we had heimerdingers reaction to the events that happened in piltover jinx ult and memorial attack i thought jayce wouldve told him or he wouldve found out after wondering where viktor went",
        "did ambessa fucking want jayce dead the chainsaw lady nearly killed him who tf would make hextech weapons then seems like she didnt think her plan through lol",
        "they definitely changed the intro style for some reason the characters are in pajamas lol",
        "we seriously couldnt have discussions for each episode",
        "man with how fastpaced this season started i wish it was spread out over a act structure or something if they werent going to do another season \n\npart of that is me loving this show and selfishly not wanting it to be over in a couple weeks thats why i always preferred weekly releases compared to binge just because it allowed more time to think on each episode and the show stayed in the public discussion longer like peak got",
        "why is singed jungling is he trolling",
        "seems like sevika is perhaps the only reasonable person able to lead the undercity i would love to see that  previously a vander supporter later switched to silco a unique mix of those two leaders",
        "guys guys guys \n\nvictor jesus",
        "i absolutely love this show and after the first acts i will say i was still blown away by the animation and the music almost even more so than last time but i feel like they really crammed so much into act  it didnt really leave much time for development and emotional depth character arcs  nuance that you coudl find in ever character in the first season which i feel like is a real shame because thats was one of my favorite parts about the show s just so much is left out i think they could have more time to flesh ideas out if they decided to make more eps stretch the story into another afew season to get a better pacing i just hope thee pacing gets better over the next few eps otherwise i absolutely love this so",
        "didnt know where else to put this and wanted to share my\u00a0theory sorry if this is obvious and im just late to the game\n\n\u00a0 i\u00a0was wracking my brain on why vi has been so ok with killing jynx now i know jynx has caused her a load of pain but to go from gotta save my sister to better kill my sister felt like a very extreme change and potential just lazy writing\n\n\u00a0however ive rewatched some elements of episode  and i think what were seeing is both jynx and vi try to double down on the idea that powder is dead when in reality jynx continues to be a character that powder plays to protect herself\u00a0\n\nfor both of them it feels easier to act this way for vi she can move on and stop feeling this guilt towards her sister while jynx can detach herself from the pain of her childhood\u00a0\n\nthis is why jynx arranges the showdown she wants either herself or vi to die in the most jynx way possible hence the spectacle and the drama the graffiti showing their past the rigged paint explosives the taunting of vi its almost like shes trying to play into the role of jynx to distance herself from powder and vi is playing along she wants to kill powder by either killing vi and severing her final connection to her past or die by vis hands this is why she says this wasnt how it supposed to go to sevika when she triggers the bombs\u00a0neither of them are dead yet\u00a0\n\nbut despite how hard she tried to play into the jynx persona shes still powder its why she repairs sevika arm saying it was something she could fix and why she saves and takes in the kid\u00a0\n\nso while both vi and jynx keep escalating in the fight with it finally culminating in vi getting the upper hand and the chance to get rid of jynx once and for all theyre interrupted by a kid who hugs jynx breaking their delusion it reveals powder to vi and shows its all an act vi is confronted by the image of her sister being hugged by this kid and being awkward about it shes not this gloating evil jynx but her awkward sister trying to play a role\u00a0\n\nyou can see vi no longer looks at jynx with hate and although she is stopping caitlin from accidentally shooting the kid i think shes partly protecting her sister again its why both caitlin and jynx are surprised by her actions",
        "definitely an interesting act  i thought victor suddenly leaving without a second thought was a little abrupt you could definitely argue the pacing was too fast we barely got any time with the task force before they were dismissed for example and theyre juggling so many different plot elements that i worry if theyll be able to tie them up properly but overall i thought it was great well see how all this pays off in the next few weeks of course but a strong if not perfect start",
        "yo whoever the new rattyyordlerobot limb guy is hes so fucking cool i love his voice acting and everything",
        "this and so will nov  and  is the best day of my",
        "i wish we had more episodes the pacing was a little crazy but i loved every second\n\nthe second i saw caitlyns direction  i knew she was going to get hate and people were gonna drill into her im disappointed and shocked at her actions but she is grieving shes never really known any loss before shes not even my favorite jinx is but she lost her mom yall   \n\nthat said seeing vi that last second was the saddest thing for me in this act i think this is the first time weve seen her break down as a adult",
        "so ambessa knows shes cant immediately impose herself on another culture so shes gonna set cait up to fail and try to swoop in and save piltover and eventually try to seize complete power",
        "ngl visually i loved it but i am very very very confused a lot of info in a few episodes ill probably watch a recap or smth on youtube later on i have a lot of questions but i hope they slow their roll because at this rate imma have the rewatch s to understand it",
        "it might be obvious at this point but i really feel like in the trailer caitlyn it clearly shows that she is absolutely putting on a show not for anyone but her there is even a curtain and she is about to perform the play\n\nwhich for me implies that she is not  herself hence i think she missed the shot in ep instead of the theory saying she actually shot vi as a warning",
        "i would mind the music video scenes less if the songs they chose werent so literalon the nose lol\n\ncharacters fight\n\nlyrics we fight \n\ncharacter takes a shot\n\nlyrics shots fired\n\ncharacter stubs toe on table\n\nlyrics fuck sharp furniture",
        "random thoughts to get my head in order\n\n i had a premonition of sky being part ofimprinted in the hexcore now confirmed\n\n sevikas fight in e was something else\n\n i liked jinxs self aware introduction to isha but i hope the marvelisms are very well measured and dont take over\n\n i really wanna know what ambessa took from the black rose\n\n i got bamboozled again by the trailers i thought they wouldnt introduce the arcane until later arcs and not \nnow so i have no idea where theyre going to take it\n\n viktors messiah arc looks dope\n\n darth caits fall tot he dark side was expected but also much better than what i imagined",
        "theres no way sauvika loses a v vs cait jinx must have told her to not harm her i think she really was planning to die there and the colors to be her last goodbye to let it all burn",
        "jayces i understand now",
        "deleted",
        "i am worried we will never get to see any evolutionresolution for the characters or plot because a too many plot points and b maybe they never intended to resolve anythinghave any kind of ending and only get the characters to the dynamic they had in the game \n\nim holding put hope for vijinx to continue being the emotional core and that once they agree on something the zaunpiltover can also have some hope of reunitingnot always attacking each other what they could see eye to eye on without disbelievingly making up idk maybe they could bond over killing kids bad because jinx has one now and is a bit tired rather than full ragecrazy im not picky anything will do to bring back that thread of hope we had in season",
        "jayce didnt go to caitlins moms funeral what the fuck bro like i get the viktor thing but thats not cool",
        "how many songs do you want\n\n\nyes \n\none every  minutes it is",
        "am i crazy or is everything just a little bit weird its like they keep trying to do these artsy or otherwise memorable scenes but season  really only had a couple of those im not saying these episodes are bad because theyre not but it does feel like they missed the forest for the trees a bit",
        "i think cait will hurt or kill someone innocent so that she could finally be reasonable again guess this process wont be too pleasant for all the characters who cares for her",
        "i had a feeling that ambessa was involved with the attack on the memorial when they didnt kill mel but damn to have it confirmed already and in such a haunting way so scaredexcited for whats to come",
        "vi didnt want to be an enforcer and the first cute enforcer girl after caitlyn butters her up and changes her mind lol",
        "hot take  season  felt better than these first  episodes of season  the latters pace is way too fast  characters dont have time to breathe and develop",
        "i cant believe vi and caitlyn formed a fascist death squad",
        "so arcane or magic in the runeterra universe is not only power but is also semi sentient\nso the devastation of the rune wars was not just caused by out of control mages but also the magic of the planet itself rebelling due to all the demands placed on it",
        "no wonder ambessa lost her holdings and her son  she thrives on conflict to the point of self destruction",
        "i wish there were discussion threads for each episode i like watching them and seeing the comments before going to the next one",
        "the thing that i am most curious about now is where does vi go from here based on the trailers i assumed becoming an enforcer would be the end of her journey in this season but instead that part seems to have come and gone in the first act considering the other trailer in which we see her in a fighting ring steadily losing her cool that seems to be next in act \n\nmy question is what comes after that will she eventually make up with caitlyn and rejoin the enforces or is that chapter in her life firmly closed does she even have a reason to go after jinx anymore might the sisters even join forces to protect zaun since shes back there or might she have a more middle path to follow in a sense becoming zauns new vander like figure\n\ni am very pleased with the direction they took vis story in here i thought i more or less knew what her story would be but now i can only throw guesses around the inversion of chapter  of season  with chapter  of season  in the way vi is left on her knees in tears as caitlyn walks away from her was poetic and rather hard hitting even if not quite as strongly as the first",
        "general question\n\nwith the trailer revealing new looks and different hairstyles for each characters and arcane season  did it once already does anybody also believe there is going to be a time skip in between act  and act  in arcane season",
        "very messy thoughts while watching but oh my god the animation is amazing im glad mel survived isha is adorable and it was nice to see jinx and sevika getting along cant believe cait was willing to use the ventilation system just to get jinx and poison people in zaun with it i get shes upset but being willing to shoot a child then insulting vi and hitting her after is messed up when she knows vi has faced a lot of violence from enforcers honestly support jinx in counteracting what cait did i feel so bad for vi and ugh ambessa manipulating caits anger cannot wait for the next episodes",
        "what if isha like amara is actually a trick of the black rose her true purpose could be to spy on jinx manipulating and controlling her to eventually shift the political balance in zaun in favor of the black rose through jinx its a wild idea but the show is so wellwritten that its hard to guess what the writers have in mind",
        "just a random thing i noticed how is jayces hammer a key to open the hextechvaultwhatever if he didnt even make the hammer until like episode  of last season",
        "holy crap i absolutely love how minimalist the second seasons first episode is compared to the first seasons im really not used to arcane being this methodical but i absolutely love it its the turn that this story needed",
        "ok jinx and sevika vs sheech is by far my favorite scene so far this season especially when jinxs theme song started playing sevikas look of annoyance and jinx dancing was the best part \n\nreally though i just like seeing the two of them getting along in general",
        "i feel so torn right now on one hand holy shit i have so many good things to say about these episodes mostly the art directionart style oh my god i have no idea how they managed to make it better but i am seriously blown away by some of the stylistic choices here its fantastic butthe pacing is just way way too fast i watched all  episodes back to back and i still feel lost on about  of the plot there was so much going on all of the time and i didnt get confirmations on some important details until i looked on here\n\nto me it seems like the creators just wanted their characters to be in very specific positions for the rest of the series cait and vi need to be opposed to each other jinx and sevika need to be allies victor needs to be a messiah on his own jayceekkoheimerdinger need to put their expertise together mel and her mother need to be at odds etc im hoping that this sort of pacing lasts only for this first act as setup and then we really get to dig into things later on but there are so many plot threads at play here\n\nthe hunt for jinx\n\njinxsevikas efforts in the underground\n\nambessas play for control\n\nmels kidnappingfeud with the witch\n\njinxs new adopted child\n\nwhatever vis role ends up being\n\nvictors messiah thing\n\nthe arcane itself\n\nthe monster that has been hinted at after every episode\n\nand those are just the threads that have had a lot of time dedicated to them i am absolutely in love with this series its characters its aesthetic its art but i cant lie im a little worried on whether or not its going to wrangle everything by the end i really really hope it does the writing was fucking phenomenal last season so you cant say that this team doesnt know what theyre doing cant wait to get hurt for the next two weeks",
        "feel like the story is going wayy to fast tbh",
        "im kinda worrried idk how theyre gonna wrap everything up besides leaving us on a huge cliffhanger",

        "i have really complicated feelings about it because likei wanted to like it and loved the first season so much and even just seeing those characters on screen again does feel great the first scene culminating in jayce frantically trying to revive viktor was incredible but in some ways it did feel like it was all downhill from therei was a bit surprised by the funeral music video but sure okay i guess i didnt love how it felt much less detailed than anything wed seen in season one but at this point i still thought it might just be an isolated stylistic choice\n\nthen the question of what to do about the situation and importantly caitlyn is at this point still concerned about innocents getting caught in the crossfire only to change her mind in a few days i guess caitlyn offers vi the enforcer badge quite randomly because why couldnt vi just continue to help without joining up dont really see a compelling reason other than cait demanding it as a weird show of loyalty as if vi hadnt literally just offered to go after her sister by herself to take her down\n\nthen theres the attack at the council meeting and likewhat was up with that i considered myself a fairly attentive viewer of the first season but i initially had no idea this was meant to be revenge about the kid jayce killed because it looked like these guys had completely new technology was it ever explained in season  what the green liquid is it doesnt look anything like shimmer but still seems to power those mech suits so likea kind of fuel also was anyone actually surprised when it turned out ambessa had engineered the whole thing because shes that horny for warpower i thought that even in season one mel literally spelled out how that was her whole thing then she literally keeps stoking the resentment mysteriously shows up to save the day and constantly encourages raids on zaun it genuinely almost made me laugh they felt the need to play a reveal montage at the end because likeyeahof course thats what happenedmel was literally suspecting this all along\n\nin general it felt like there was way too much new nonsense established and too many new plots introduced when it would have been completely fine and honestly much more suspenseful to just develop the ones that were already set up in the last season it could be as few as\n\n vi and cait have to decide what to do about jinx maybe there is some conflict with the council and also between the two of them we actually develop why it matters to cait that vi joins the enforcers and vi talks about why she wont i know she was one in the game but feel like they could have just changed this in the show then when they start hunting for jinx there is a gradual build about caitlyns increasing use of force that vi grows uncomfortable with we could have slowly build toward the use of the poisonous gas as a weapon and its an ideal weapon to show the civilian cost of an approach like this because gas is obviously hard to control and direct maybe we also learn a tiny bit more about the new enforcer characters who just seem random and barely there\n jinx and sevika try to regain control over silcos empire because they both feel lost without a direction and also love violence and mayhem but maybe distrust starts to creep in because jinx is still a wanted criminal and sevika might once again start to worry that jinx is too unpredictable and unstable above everything hangs the eventual reveal that jinx was the one who killed silco which once sevika finds out would of course destroy any collaboration between them maybe we have another jinx and silco parallel with the kid growing increasingly close to jinx and jinx feeling very uncomfortable about this because shes reminded of herself so much this could have let to more flashbacks which were entirely absent for her so far this season\n jayce and viktor actually being allowed more screen time together bc what the hell was that they could still have shown viktor gradually discovering his powers and jayce trying to learn more about the wild magic problem possibly bumping into heimerdinger why is he even still underground with echo and echo while they are both already down there also sparing us that annoying and completely unnecessary breaking into the lab scene maybe the related and also very annoying sick tree mystery is still there but just barely jayce could grow uncomfortable with viktors new weird jesus vibe and power and generally grow more wary of hex tech and other magic also because he was once again forced to use it in weaponry like caitlyns rifle which he told himself hed never do again viktor insists this is different but its also clear something is off",
        "the more i think about it the more i am annoyed by them just releasing the grey upon the people of zaun without them ever talking about it  i am sure that vi would have to say something about it but the show just plays a oneminute music video about this atrocious act and then kinda hopes the viewer wont notice just how big vis betrayal to her people was at that moment\n\njinx mentions it later but the weight of vis decision is completely lost it seems like she just went along with it because of caitlyn which is incredibly weak and honestly out of character\n\nthis is by far the worst part of s for me right now and i dont think they will be able to fix this and what it means for vis character\n\nim still positive about this season but i dont think it will be as good as season  which  at least to me  really excelled at showing what makes the characters tick",

        "im not surprised with the whole caitlyn reactions  but again thats the point\n\ncaitlyn believed piltover and zaun could coexist  should that piltover had wronged zaun for too long  and she got a murdered mother and as she sees it a defaced memorial to her memory as a reward  and her pain gets manipulated by ambessa\n\nso of course shes full of all consuming hate  and its turned her into a monster  just as jinxs pain made her a literal mass murderer  and vis has made her adrift and unsure of her place\n\ni think as others have said the fast pace does a disservice at times  sure it represents the utter chaos that has just exploded yet it also means we have to kind of rush though act",
        "am i the only one a bit disappointed by viktor so far its partly because he is one of my favorite characters but i feel like im one of the few people not disappointed by much besides viktor i really like caitlyn turning villain i like sevika and jinx saying to burn it all down vi doesnt seem to have too much going down but given the clip we have seen im sure theres more with her the entire stuff with the black rose and ambessa is great i even like how jayce is kinda depressed sad for the first couple episodes because his friend is in stasis\n\nthe only one i havent been able to find something to vibe with is viktor and is tech jesus undercity cult like if it was built up a bit more then maybe i would be fine with it but the dude gets out of his coma sees his devastated friend and fucked off to the undercity to start a cult saying its time for him to leave now lol\n\nit just doesnt really make sense the best way to say is it feels like they killed viktor and replaced him with this messiah and i dont really vibe with that tbh he doesnt seem to have much agency anymore",

        "initial impression holy shit this is awesome\n\nafterthought i wish there was more of an emotional punch\n\nafterafterthought i dont think this act needed to be as emotionally traumatizing act  of season  there were still moments that had me a little choked up but i think the point of this act was to set the stage for the rest of the show we got the war we got jinx finding a new purpose we got the start of caits dictator arc and vi trying and failing to rationalize caits actions we got the underlying threat of the arcane and the start of viktors religion overall i think i feel pretty similarly about this season as i did about last season after watching act  hyped confused maybe a little disappointed but not quite as traumatized that said as season  continued things started to shape up and i got over any disappointment i may have had as a fan of the lore\n\nalso im pretty confident we got to see a certain member of clan ferros at the end of episode  and it has me hyped",

        "and like that would be enough and also feel more balanced instead we basically just get countless music videos for a lot of important moments that should have been normal scenes very little actual dialogue between characters whose relationships make up a huge part of the show like vi and cait or jayce and viktor there is way too much time spent on kaitlyns angst about her mum and not enough on jinxs angst about silco which again was the much more crucial and interesting relationship in the show and maybe worst of all except for one of them none of the fights we see had any stakes\n\nthe first one felt so annoyingly videogamey something i always thought the show impressively avoided in the entire first season because it was this uniform new group of enemies many different people on the same team fighting this new group and also it was clear that none of the main characters were in any danger because this was literally just the first episode and these were completely inconsequential enemies the fight between jinx sevika and the rat cyborg chem baron guy was fun enough if only because the new arm jinx made for sevika goes against everything sevika stands for and she looked hilariously disgusted with it for the entire fight and i also liked jinxs little mimed instructions on how to use parts of it buuuut this also could have been much better if it actually represented something larger in the story like a genuine team up between these characters a new alliance or a defeat over an enemy who wed established as in some way ruthless or dangerous instead of someone who was introduced what felt like five seconds ago as just another forgettable mook\n\non top of all the stuff from the first season thats not developed that well they also introduced so much new stuff the gasgrey the wild magic the wild magic being in some way angered by the use of hex tech ambessas enemies with their black rose magic whatever happened with those enemies whatever happened with her son mel investigating both of those things viktor who was already fusing with magic and technology in odd ways in season one is nowexperiencing the same thing again but even more intensely echos tree is sick and that is his biggest concern this season for some reason theres random new enforcers we know nothing about who are then send home hilariously quickly and for no good reason too like if one of them got injured because redhaired whatsherface made a rookie mistakewas jumpy it would have made sense for vi to send them home because she considered them liabilities but nothing even happens shes just a bit spooked by jinxs voodoo doll thing which seems completely legitimate but i also dont really care about these characters so not a big deal\n\ndespite all this extra stuff there was apparently no time for anyone to elect a new council which youd think would matter what happens if all of them but one die is that person just the de facto leader of the free world now i thought it was hilarious that all the decision making was now just left with the three of them instead ofother families moving up as the next in line for this council hell towards the end it felt like ambessa was already basically calling the shots and barely even needed caitlyn to be her sock puppet i also just didnt think she was anywhere near as compelling a villainprimary antagonist as silco his motivations but also his strengths and weaknesses were always really clear we got to know him and his relationship with vander and jinx so well with ambessa i feel like i still know so little about her other than she apparently wants all the power in piltover and has the reputation of being really great at fighting even if the show hasnt shown us much of that yet",

        "season  for me is a masterpiece and after watching s act  i realise that a reason for that is  because the writers took their time\n\nminus the opening of episode  i didnt feel like there was a single quiet moment for example when jinx is holding silco in the water theres dialogue all through that scene we didnt even see her actually bury him except for that one shot during the music video montage \n\ni rewatched s leading up to s and i agree with a lot of the comments here that the characters all feel completely different its almost like watching a different show the dialogue isnt half as good and the music is way too overplayed in s the music was written for specific scenes and uplifted their emotional impact it doesnt feel the same here\n\nobviously we still have  acts to go but the tone already feels very different these are just my thoughts anyway",
        "the funeral scene was just beautiful absolutely a highlight of the show for me so far im feeling the story really lacks a strong throughline that was silcos character he was an incredibly complex character whose machinations kept the rest of the plot moving tightly so far it seems like a lot of moving pieces that i hope will come together gracefully",

        "there wasnt much that surprised me but thats not really a bad thing the previews and trailers made it pretty clear what the act  structure would be\n\ni think the biggest surprise is how things went down with vi caitlyn and jinx vi didnt stop caitlyn from killing jinx she stopped her from potentially killing a kid if that kid didnt intervene jinx would be dead i guess this explains why she leaves vi alone during her goth phase in act",
        "cait with the military dictator arc is definitely not what i anticipated but im here for it",
        "wait was it ever explained what smeech and his gang saw in that abandoned area with all the passed out people and that scary figure in the grey like the scene just ended and smeech just popped up in the council and said nothing about it",
        "why didnt that zaunite guy kill mel when he had the chance he could have just shot her in the face and then went none of you are safe  it would have carried more weight since she was a councilwoman",
        "another point about vi i am curious about the new opening credits start with her rubbing out the vi tattoo on her face followed by jinx emerging from behind her the tattoo comes up in story when one of the new enforcer characters says your name is written on your face is this just more of a practical action to go incognito in zaun after breaking away from the enforcers or does it hold some deeper meaning such as a new identity powder does become jinx after all it does make me wonder if perhaps their story arcs will end up paralleling each others",
        "hell of a final plot twist i reaalllyy hope that this is just setup for the rest of the season and not indicative of the structure of the next  episodes the pacing in the final episode was good but it felt like they tried to rush super hard towards ending of this act the pacing of the episodes was super wonky so much had to happen and it felt like there really wasnt enough time to breathe for the characters or the story \n\nthough in fairness in my opinion the first act of season  had this issue but backwards whereas season  act  took a bit too much time to get to the end season  act  feels like it does not take enough time to really feel out the emotions of the characters though i wouldnt be too hasty with making judgments of the quality of the rest of the season just from what is essentially the prologue as it seems that theres going to be a time skip  months \n\nit does feel like the writing is weaker this act than season one but thats coming off of me just rewatching season  yesterday and my opinion might change as the rest of the acts get released but so far definitely the weakest act writing wise out of them all \n\nthis act is lacking something i cant really put my finger on what but if i had to it would be subtletyefficiency part of what made season one so good is that every conversation and scene usually served more than one purpose but that seems to be rarer this season fewer character moments overall they tried to fit more into what feels like less doesnt make this season bad not at all i love episode  and it feels closest to season  in terms of writing but still lack that critical something that made the first season really click for me \n\nat the same time though i wasnt the biggest fan of season  act  opening acts do not seem to be the strong suit of this team \n\nif i had to give it a scale rating where season  act  is a  this act would be a solid  i have some mixed feelings for it that i hope improve as the rest of the season releases",
        "this doesnt feel like season  episodes  this feels like season  episodes  so much of these few episodes were used to resolve leftopen plotlines from season  to the point it felt like an epilogue so much of these new plotlines are complete mysteries though we havent even gotten more than a dozen speaking lines from caitlynvis new friends im super excited for the next  episodes but i really hope things slow down and are actually able to breathe the reason why season  imo worked so well was the amazing structure and pacing i just hope this season can keep up with the excellency of the previous season cautiously optimistic",
        "this show is beyond art its the next generation of quality and animation like i had goosebumps for most of the act and when i didnt have goosebumps my mouth was just slightly fucking open the entire time\n\nfortiche i worship you",
        "is vi being a hypocrite she didnt think much of jayce accidentally killing a child but has a problem with cait possibly shooting a child is it because she deep down doesnt want jinx dead",
        "for everyone calling caitlyn hitler last i checked hitler wasnt given the seat of power based on his familys prestige reputation and historic government influence by a foreign military general nor were his motivations based on grieving said government family member caitlyn is going through a corruption arc  and is doing bad things but she has  political motivations and only accepted ambessas offer through literal peer pressure and vengeance",
        "great act feel like they could tone down the music a bit though",
        "so yeah in season  the vijinxsilco stuff was incredibly compelling and the piltover politics were incredibly weak\n\nwondering if there will be something good going on in the later acts but since silco is dead odds are not that great",
        "the reveal of ambessa paying off those assassins was weird we all knew she did it but the reveal just felt so hamfisted",
        "its  am and im exhausted so these are just my first thoughts for me the pacing was kinda weird in some places too fast in others too slow i was zoning out in quite a few scenes to be honest scenes dragged but then there was no breathing room for others some of the dialogue was odd seems like many mostly fight scenes went for style new animation techniques styles music montages over substance and plot hope this is just for act  due to picking up where s left off",
        "so my initial thoughts wow i typed a lot bare with me overall act  was excellent \n\nthe pace was quick a little too quick at one or two points but nothing was missing in the end\n\n\nthe new visuals for the intro were amazing caitlyn in particular with the shadow of her hands making a twisted crown was perfect \n\n\nambessas machinations and her motivations makes her amazing in every single scene shes in and also absolutely infuriating as she should be i think her decision to keep mel at a distance by appearing an enemy to her is such a contrast with other parental figures like vander and i cant help but think that its her ultimate failing well see as the show progresses i guess\n\n\npretty sure mel has magical powers that shes unaware of but ambessa probably knows about them\n\n\nas expected caitlyns downward spiral is so heartbreaking but portrayed convincingly the violet heh petals in her sanctuary turning grey and shrivelled was such a beautiful metaphor of her fading hope and increasing coldness and then seeing a single petal just before she takes the first shot at jinx im certain shell come out of this eventually but until then its going to get worse \n\n\nthe lid of her mothers coffin closing shut as the camera cuts to caitlyns face like were saying goodbye to caitlyn as we knew her in a way i could go on and on with the visual metaphors the entire sequence with i cant hear it now was hearbreaking for cait \n\n\nvi oh vi caught between a rock and a hard place doing her best to do what she thinks is right even as caitlyn becomes more and more ruthless as time passes  its really telling that she drew the line at putting the kid at risk she couldnt bare that or maybe she wanted to protect cait in a way keep her from making such an awful mistake like jayce did either way it was a good way to show a line that vi would not choose to cross and how caitlyn doesnt understand that yet her tenderness towards caitlyn trying to comfort her was really beautiful the kiss was perfect but it also shows how theyre not really on the same page yet even if they care about each other the hit to the gut made me gasp poor vi  \n\nedit also a direct parallel to vi hitting powder in episode \n\n\nthe fight with vi and jinx was amazing woodkids song is amazing the whole thing was amazing and then we have the gemstones being linked together with the wild rune if thats what it actually is was quite the revelation that whole sequence with jayce heimerdinger and ekko was a incredible\n\n\njinx remains awesome in every scene shes in it was something i could fix really stands out to me about who jinx really is deep down she only wanted to help after all\n\n\nthe songs oh the songs they were all fantastic even the one during sevikas fight with smeech the levity of jinxs inventive goofiness and sevikas reaction to the new arm was fun i didnt really want to like it but i did the hellfire sequence was visually stunning \n\n\nsinged casually working on his pet project at the end of each episode building up to something or someone whom weve all been guessing about for a while is a great way to build up the anticipation good stuff\n\n\njayce and viktor ive always liked them but never fully engaged with them like i did with vijinxcaitlyn but jayces genuine concern and desire to save viktor really struck me here he broke his promise but i cant say i blame him under the circumstances viktor healing the shimmer addicts and huck is conflicting for me there might be a good intent behind it but theres also something really foreboding about it all maybe i just find messianic figure creepy it almost feels like the hexcore is manipulating viktor through the memory of sky or maybe it really is sky speaking to him its so intriguing not to mention the use of hextech affecting the tree at ekkos hideout \n\n\nthe only character i feel comfortable outright despising is salo well performed but represents the worse of piltover\n\nmy only criticism at this point is that some of the scenes could have breathed a little more i know this increases the run time but sometimes you need those scenes that just sits with the characters for a bit longer i wouldnt go so far as to say rushed but it was quick at times not a whole lot of time to get to know caits squad so far\n\nok ive rambled enough  im going to catch on some sleep now\n\nedit i instantly recognized maddies voice actress as the same who voices suvi in mass effect andromeda havent heard her voice elsewhere so i had one of those i know that voice moments",

        "i really enjoyed this but i dont feel like the writing is as strong as the first act of season   nowhere near particularly the first episode felt like a bit of a mess but i think its easing into it largely i think the vicaitjinx dynamic was basically solved at the end of season  so all the time spent rehashing it trying to get vi and caitlyn back into conflict was a little tiring \n\nevery other plotline is really engaging though and military dicator caitlyn is far too cool of an idea to pass over so i understand why they regressed her character to fit very excited to see how all the different threads interact going forward \n\nas far as the animation goes its still very imaginative but the facial expressions arent nearly as expressive as they were in season  peoples cheeks stay largely static and its mostly lip flaps eyebrows and squinting now compare this to the first episode of season  which was just phenomenal in regards to this see vis expression  mylo in that episode nothing in these episodes comes even close \n\nstill super enjoyable though like a solid",
        "step down from season  so far but im enjoying it a ton still the pacing is odd at times and they very much leaned into the stylized scenes which worked fantastically in season  but felt a little overdone here i dont really like the abstract montages they also made it simultaneously more complicated and less personal even the the personal story of vi and powder was what made season  so exceptional so i kinda hoped theyd be able to expand the story while still keeping that amotional punch which wasnt the case in this arc but can still be done",
        "kinda confused on vis switch up in this act she went from i still hate enforcers with every fiber of my being to yeah ill wear the uniform and use chemical warfare on my own people in the same episode i wouldnt even count the attack at the memorial as some kind of inciting event that changes her mind even when shes talking to cait after the attack she kind of brushes it off saying they just want the spectacle and theyre just trying to scare you so what changed are they just trying to cram her into her final form according to lol lore it just seems very unlike her to not only put on that uniform but also use something like the grey against the people of the underground",
        "also the whole class issue theme in the show reminds me a lot of current human beings being ignored by the international community in favor of classists raping killing posting it to tiktok and getting away with it because of one retaliatory attack which they keep calling terrorism while what theyve been doing for years to the worse than poor community gets sidelined cause classists and privileged people rarely understand if ever cait cant lead her people out of this shit show shes continuing and worsening her privilege shows in how shes been living in luxury and peace while the ones abused by topside do one retaliation and she loses herself in a selfish aftermath like okay you lost your mother doesnt mean you get to take away everyone elses by gassing a whole people to death\u00a0\n\n\nedit also you cant judge the oppressed on the moral codes of the oppressor and  times the oppressor is a hypocrite whose morals only apply to talking and justifying oppression on the oppressed and god if once the oppressed resist how the world frowns",
        "episode  caitlyn shot at the big hulk  times and shot at the same exact spot she  shot jinx trigger finger shot the gun out of the little girls hand and youre going to tell me she wouldve miss",
        "so far love it\ni feel like it can go soo many different directions and not knowing what the endgame is makes this show even better for me",
        "lissan al gab",
        "i cannot stop staring into his eyes whenever hes on screen jesus arc  i really did not expect sky to still be in the hexcore im kind of wondering if its a parasitic manifestation designed to manipulate viktor but i hope not i was really happy to see her again",

        "whatever the hell was going on the nerd squad\n\nhey man this edible aint shit",
        "up there with the bridge scene imo for best in the show \n\njust incredible visuals reveals and crazy high stakes",
        "this season is already more styalized in its presentation than a lot of season  was i kind of dig it",
        "yeah those were godlike transitions",
        "further proof that ekko is the most stable person on the show by a wide margin",
        "the only man on the show whos concerned with the present",
        "its amazing that she built chaos and unpredictability into it neither side knows whats coming next but its going to be crazy",
        "there most likely is there have been plenty theories about mel possibly having powers hence why we saw her armor glow at the end of season  and her eyes opening with a gold colour at the end of the blood sweat and tears music video",
        "lol jayce is aware of his own plot armour",
        "i feel pretty confident that there is right before she was struck by the attacker at the memorial her outfit glowed faintly just like before the bombing and at the beginning she was shielding jayce and her outfit glowed and we know that the noxians have access to magic i feel pretty confident that mels outfit is enchanted",
        "it almost activated when the guy came up behind her with the pistol too during the memorial you could see the same greying or color flushing out around her as it happened",
        "also a lot of people dont know about this but all the golden markings on mel are actually tattoos the shine that we see at the end of s is her inner body glowing to protect her like in the bst mv",
        "guardian angel  her gold pauldronsjewellery or henna or whatever is vaguely reminiscent of it and has shimmered noticeably at key moments",

        "all zaunites belong to the gray",
        "her class is definitely showing even if shes drowning in grief oil and water i guess",
        "glad they went into some detail with her also it seems like she gets respect in piltover as well with the shrine cait was at",
        "so shes not an ancient god but someone zaunites made up recently",
        "wait when",
        "that clip was released as a teaser stealth mission i believe so if you want to read comments regarding that you can search for that thread",
        "one of the things i like about this season so far is that theres a lot more variation in tone we had our brief cartoonishwhimsical moments in s mostly with single facial expressions like vis this face will always mean shut up or when they get caught sneaking in or heimers pet but it was pretty somber overall i like scenes like this heimers indignant oh pishposh like youve never snuck in here before cough se cough vi meeting maddie for the first time or the straightup slapstick sevika vs smeech just as a counterpoint to all the heavy stuff elsewhere",
        "looks at my own avatar laughs nervously",
        "now we can insult her mother in the chat lobby",
        "she literally did as a champ haha",
        "i didnt catch that thats hilarious",
        "im so curious to find out what ambessas motive is also black rose give us lebonk fortiche even a couple frames will do",
        "its grief despair and sorrow",
        "yes less subtle writing would have had her say you could say that or in a way or something along those lines to hammer it in but im so glad they let that moment play out quietly we know he means casualties but we can guess what vis thinking of i missed arcanes storytelling",
        "we were always gonna get pricefielded",
        "hahaha as a shipper of angst ridden enemies to lovers im living",

        "you need air spoken like a zaunite",
        "considering amaras fate as well as what happened to mel in ep  did you scream yet",
        "theyre setting up the next series after arcane thats set in noxus with ambessa as lead character",
        "that wordless exchange between sevika and jinx killed me lol",
        "genuinely such an enjoyable watch i really appreciate how arcane takes advantage of its medium so much animation these days focuses on hyperrealism instead of actually allowing the medium to be its own art and leaning into what it can be that fight along with other scenes really emphasized the love the team has for animation",
        "kinda sad he died loved his character design",
        "her family building vents because people from the undercity deserved to breathe and caitlyn using those vents to poison them \n\nway to undo her familys legacy",
        "s this city needs healing\n\ns lets loose some supernaturallyevil smog into the undercity so we can gas poor people to death",
        "it is really incredible how cait took something good her mother did for the undercity and turned it into a weapon to bring justice for her mother the first time i saw her learning about her families secrets i thought oh shit is she going to learn that her family did some fucked up shit but its the complete opposite of that a really fucking cool way of subverting our expectations while fleshing out caitlyn and her mother",
        "how did vi allow that",
        "ive heard of toxic yuri but this is ridiculous",
        "i think vi is starting to notice a bit of a pattern in her life that sort of parallels jinxs own pattern jinx realizes that the people who get close to her tend to die by her hand while vi realizes that the people around her change into monsters i created the monster how true this is of the character bad luck and the actions of others is beside the point its how the perceive themselves which going back to your comment to my post on how vi will question her sense of selfworth during this season now seems entirely on point\n\nin a sense i think vi will have to decide what she wants to fight for in terms of her own values and motivations so far she has fought for other people for vander for powder for cait not entirely for herself considering the trailer showing her aimlessly fighting in the arena that seems like a perfect representation of her situation taken to the extreme in that it no longer even matters who she is fighting or for what purpose for the first time she has a problem she cant solve by fighting but shes still trying her best to do just that",
        "i knew there would be no sunsine and rainbows for those two atleast not right now but man that scene broke me a bit",
        "i need happy lesbians by the end of this show i sg",
        "i cried at the beginning of episode  during jinxs monologue and nearly again when she saw vi in that enforcer outfit my heart wrenches for her and im in love with her characterization it feels very strange for a child to take a liking to her it definitely seems like a mirror to silco caring for powder\n\noh gosh yes that opening scene was so tragic and beautiful especially how she compares him to vi both people who looked out for her in their own ways and fought against each other and now she has neither shes truly alone which is interesting given how her relationships with sevika and that kid might evolve\n\ni think if jinx saved my life when i was a kid id totally be enamoured with her lol shes very cool",
        "ive never felt worse for jinx than when she was hiding from caits squad \n\nchoking on the haze while vague shadows stalk you seeing her own sister legitimately become her sleep paralysis demon \n\nhad to be absolutely nightmarish",
        "viktor is by far the most interesting part of this season imo more of him please",
        "yeah her arc seems like its going to focus on the dark things people do in the name of vengeance",
        "i think its because she has more political and military power to cause actual disastrous consequences with her lashing out shes inherently in a more privileged position this is why people are getting the ick",
        "you dont get it when jinx works as a gang enforcer for years and kills scores of zaunites shes actually a small baby not responsible for her actions\n\nwhen a grief filled caitlyn leads raids against zaunite gangs and as far as we can tell doesnt kill a single person shes clearly fantasy hitler",
        "having a character who was more morally light getting morally darker is a lot harder for people to deal with than characters who start off on the amoral side of things and get better",
        "now you know a fraction of what its like being a jayce fan",
        "its no wonder shes on a dark path i didnt realize how alone caitlyn is in her family shes got no one now her mother is dead and her father doesnt seem to be functional vi called her out too late on her actions and caitlyn cut her away so shes ripe for the picking for ambessas influence unfortunately i cant wait to see caitlyn figure ambessas bullshit out i really dig the direction her story is going but i need it to have a great payoff",
        "caitlyns soul and our sanity",
        "you took the words right out of my mouth none of the story moves made have been bad per say but they needed way more buildup and time to breathe specifically viktor and jayces breakup and vi giving up on powder",
        "since this is the last season i suspect theyre trying to speed run as much plot as they can before it all wraps up wish they at least planned for a threeseason arc so all the story beats had some time to breathe",
        "did they witewally just break up",
        "i think what they are going for in episode  is a direct continuation of episode  its the fallout the panic the loss a jumble of emotions and confusion as the days slip by theres a lot of stuff to get through in the aftermath\n\nthat said the strobing was a bit heavy",
        "episode  seems a little better paced but it also strikes me that its constructed in such a way that youre really supposed to treat these  seasons like one long season so episode  pacing is closer to that of episode  or  though its kinda strange still",
        "makes me sad that this story is done after this season this show and animation is just so incredible i wish i could have it for longer",
        "all  of these episodes seem packed the characters never step through the earlier parts of a conversation or jump straight to what the audience is wondering but a character wouldnt necessarily know without a bit of a chat first\n\nmaybe its formatted this way to keep the first few episodes short in anticipation of longer slower episodes later",
        "i think it definitely felt like we sped so quickly through the death of caits mother choosing the drawn style had me sweating for a bit about the pacing and budgeting i was feeling better after the start of the first episode and going into the second \n\nit feels jarring to see new characters and development after ruminating on the first season for several years",
        "i agree the pacing imo is all over the place not much happened episode  then a million things happened in the next two the show is definitely prioritizing cool and efficient with its storytelling and it makes sense to reserve this incredible top notch and expensive animation for the highest impact scenes but it comes with the risk of confusing the audience and neglecting the character motivationsdevelopment the first scene had such excellent characterdriven story i hope the second season doesnt usurp that",
        "heimer is borderline character assassinated in s which is sad to see they turned him into a comic relief who does silly things on screen while others are having serious conversations and concerns which is a far cry from the wise and careful  year old genius mentor who is just witnessing all his fears coming true \n\nthe entire dynamic between him ekko and jayce is totally off why would jayce calmly except a leader of a zaunite gang and a retired councilor who are breaking into his lab why does ekko have no problems with jayce or heimer for that matter when we know how he lost it talking to cait about piltover in se why is heimer so damn calm when the very mention of magic getting out of hand was enough to give him ptsd flashbacks in season",
        "while he was very sad about it i genuinely dont believe heimer holds a grudge about it he was more concerned for his students humanity when he got fired",
        "heimer really doesnt strike me as the kind of person to hold a grudge he was hurt when jayce evicted him but ultimately he realized that it allowed him to see things from a new angle that hed lost from his high vantage point",
        "is jayce even in the council hes in the lab the whole  episodes and not in the room when they are taking serious votes especially in episode  when they voted to have the strike team i wasnt sure why they were having this meeting without him it was only  because he wasnt in the room to back mel up",
        "imagine hating on general milf\n\ncouldnt be me",
        "which medarda",
        "so caitlyn will be a ambessa puppet like vader was palpatine puppet",
        "can she though i feel the opposite",
        "i only watched it once so far and didnt study the details that closely so take this with a grain of salt i got the impression that he already was an enforcer and was drinking because he lost someone in jinxs attack his outfit seemed like an enforcer uniform and then he helped during the memorial attack even though he was technically off duty but of course had the skills and will to help",
        "obvious vander resemblance hes going to die saving her or something and shock vi into protecting the family again  hes going to justify his whole existence with a vander parallel right before he dies id bet money on it",
        "he didnt join the enforcers he was an enforcer before he met vi you can see his uniform from the very start",
        "i agree for sure\n\ni think it definitely feels busy not necessarily rushed i think its done well i dont necessarily think were supposed to have time to breathe even if we want it its one thing after another and piltover is slipping you feel the tension with all of the characters\n\ncait is drowning in vengeance vi is clawing for moral stability in an uncertain world jayce is running worrying and scrapping for his life as hes chased by his mistakes jinx is crumbling into herself while she schemes the death of the one she loved most mel and ambessa are clinging for a highground against unseen enemies and the list goes on\n\nthe only tranquility we really get is in viktors scenes imo which sort of highlights his position and peace as messiah\n\nedit i will say the show has time to redeem itself on this but for now the new characters definitely feel very out of place when suddenly appearing in all these existing story threads the new enforcers especially havent had any moments to be developed and it feels like they walked in from a different show like we were already supposed to know them \n\ni like the little girl but having her be the deciding interference in jinx and vis fight to the death was an interesting choice right now it doesnt feel like the right one but im really hoping the show can make me fall in love with her",
        "hard agree i just finished rewatching the first season and went directly to this and i didnt notice anything wrong with the pacing at all i think the problem is people are expecting it to be like season s act  \n\ni think if they look at this more as act  a continuation of act  theyll feel more satisfied with the overall pacing and character developments",
        "yeah none of the characters are acting well out of character but it does feel like the story doesnt really have time to breathe like theres almost a checklist of things that need to happen in this act so that we can get to the good shit which is why we have  debatable montages in  episodes still excellent i just feel dejected that we now have to wait another week for more when these  episodes felt like we did so much but saw so little",
        "someone remarked that cait hitting vi was reminiscent of vi hitting powder and i have never been the same since tt",
        "your comment perfectly sums up almost everything i felt extra thoughts to add\n\n i literally watched ep  with my mouth open half the time lol esp when jayce got chainsawed jfc i knew he wasnt going to die but it looked bad\u00a0\n\n the enforcer guy vi was drinking with resembles vander and am i the only one who felt that the junior enforcer looks a lot like marcuss daughter probs reading too much into it but i felt like that was somewhat symbolic of the way vi and cait were joining forces at first\n\n caits grief made me want to cry i think her character arc makes total sense her mothers death was the catalyst to push her to action but as you said her slow descent into her current headspace was extremely well done also now vi  caits story mirror each other both of them had their parents killed by the other side and both felt that fire and rage fueling them but caits fire is being tended due to her privilegebackground like the resources and people she has access to and ofc ambessas manipulation so now i feel like caits story would be what vi would have been like if vander hadnt tried to set her on the right path and all\n\n nooo why is no one talking about jayce and viktor parting ways rip jayce running and carrying viktors body was similar to silco carrying jinx in attempt to save her viktor becoming a savior for those forgotten people is very interesting tho i really want to know how it will play into the bigger picture\n\n sevika saying that she cant give up their own people like vander had said was nice then her and jinx teaming up over the loss of silco  im here for it esp given their feelings for each other in s also the arm lmao cool af though jinx continues to break my heart\n\n heimerdinger sneaking into the lab was so cute a much needed laugh and breather\n\n isha  did i miss her name being mentioned somewhere during the episodes i hope we get the back story of why the others were chasing and trying to kill her \n\n the black rose thing freaks me tf out like that first scene when it grabs ambessa and her guard omg also im so confused is it an entity that can jump from peoplehost to host like was amara always a part of this black rose thing or was it like speaking through amara\n\n ambessa  interesting to see that people are only expressing their dislike of her now in s i was surprised at how many people liked her character and said she was super badass esp according to a lot of reactors ive seen she already felt so manipulative and clearly knew how to play the game very well so i was already wary of her in s but i admit her storyline is getting more intriguing and i appreciate the complexity of her motivations and actions\n\n animation was absolutely captivating as usual especially paired with the soundtrack felt like my jaw was dropped a lot of the time lol also makes me sooo excited for tps song yes they are the reason i initially started watching arcane but im so so glad no regrets i was instantly obsessed haha\n\noops i didnt realize i had so many more thoughts to add on top of yours lolll suffice to say i am really excited for the rest of the season",
        "people had  years to imagine stuff they werent going to get",
        "people will always complain",
        "eh people complained about the first four seasons of game of thrones and breakiing bad too its all good no show is perfect\n\nim also happy with the story so far im kind of drowning on the amount of mystery and things i dont know and i want them to start getting into the meat of the whole show but im enjoying it so far",
        "im with you here pal however the thing that is hittin the must in a bad way is the abuse of music staged action i remember when someone said that suicide squad was just a train of musical videos this is pretty much how i am feeling about this  episodes the characters decisions are all over the place they dont feel emotional nor erratic just incoherent",
        "this\n\n\nive been thinking of the same thing jayce was going to die\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nthough my conclusion is that she is after not after hextech weapons after all but something else\u00a0\n\n\notherwise that would be a foolish mistake and as elora said ambessa is anything but a fool",
        "ambessas plan to use caitlyn hinges on jayce mel and viktor conveniently disappearing in unrelated subplots so that they cant oppose her and which she did nothing to make happen\n\nher plans in general arent really all that well thought out",
        "someone could probably figure out hextech weapons with access to his notes after she talked with him before she might view him more as a barrier than a necessity alternatively ambessa is crazydesperate enough to bank on capturing jinx as a means of figuring hextech weapons out if her people cant do it imo the biggest hole in her plan is if mel is there and ambessa has no reason to think shes not going to be there if mel is there shes just going to tell caitlyn whats she up to",
        "i think its meant to show the characters in their barest state without actually showing them nude  note how vi doesnt even have her tattoos and she wipes the vi from her face at the start",
        "did you notice that it showed ambessa being possessedreplaced by a black rose witch with her eyes glowing and her holding a rose and in the next shot mel sits on ambessas sofa with only a black rose besides her in ambessas place",
        "i like it better than the statues tbh it felt too netflixy if it makes sense",
        "to me it seemed like a roman aesthetic",
        "we can if we want kick it off",
        "i honestly hope that viktor is the sleeper main plot of act  hes my main man my best boy he can do no wrong",
        "some of the pacing was kinda off like they cut some connecting scenes there and there i really hope that we somehow get a directors cut of the whole  seasons",
        "im seeing a lot of people complain about the pacing i agree its quite fast possibly to a fault but i also feel like have people forgotten season  was the same way\n\nseason  brought us such moments as\n\njayce full of passion to his mother if you wont support me ill find someone who will\n\ngets rejected exactly once by the kirammans\n\njayce wellp time to kill myself\n\nand how could we forget what about us bish you met each other like yesterday",
        "yeah shame he died so early i liked his brief appearance in season one too",
        "smeech hes in the new tft set",
        "yeah but nov  will be the worst",
        "doubt that she wants to separate herself from mel to keep mel safe so her goal is likely to make piltover a stable city for mel to rule while she gets access to hextech weaponry without mels permission",
        "interesting theory but i think she just wants someone who is a pawn i dont think they she has the numbers because it seems like her standing in noxus is bad due to the black rose",
        "yeah when she nominated cait my mind immediately went back to her line mel is safer as the enemy i dont know if shes gambling on cait failing but she clearly sees her as more expendable than mel",
        "theres just have a lot of gaps left in the plot",
        "a lot of references are made on theatres plays like the screen with the crown made with her fingers ive seen in another thread is like the poster of macbeth viktor with the mask is like the phantom of the opera",
        "nah the shot would have killed jinx but vi blocked it",
        "i actually love how the songs are curated so specifically for the scenes",
        "in regards to your point of what ambessa took from the black rose \n\ni dont know why but i have a gut feeling its mel like she literally took her away from them and thats why they killed her son wild stupid theory i know \n\nabout victor i can only say one thing lisan al gaib",
        "yeah it really just seemed like a way to kill herself",
        "they fucked that up in other language trailers lol there were subs from the french or german trailer with the full half your council line probably because not all languages use the same sentence structure so you cant just remove the start of the line",
        "lol that is my one complait about s too many songs",
        "not sure if this is what youre referring to but the repeated use of musical montages felt a bit off to me this time around  like they were being overused even though the moment didnt seem to organically call for it  there were also some moments of artistic stylization that felt a bit shoehorned in for the sake of spectacle rather than because they added something to the storytelling",
        "i actually kind of like it some of the best moments of season  were the more artsy segments ive gone back and watched guns for hire and the ekko vs jinx fight on their own loads of times theres still plenty of normal scenes though and i think itll feel better as we rewatch and continue the season",
        "i noticed this as well",
        "feels like they have way too much to do and are jumping all over the place lack of focus i feel",
        "maybe im just for a sucker but i do really enjoy them switching up their styles for certain scenes so i have no complaints so far\n\ni totally get if people feel that its too overthetop as well",
        "hearing that caitlyn really went to bat for her to get her the badge probably worked that crush magic on her lol i think vi would probably be a little susceptible to compliments like that after a life of carrying huge responsibilities on her shoulders with basically no thanks or praise its understandable and all the more devastating when that one person who always stood up for her turns her back",
        "vi is going to be fighting hard to stop the cop fetish allegations",
        "i mean season  came with a multiyear time jump between parts  and  where they speedran vi and powders childhood trauma in three episodes i think season  moved pretty quick too",
        "tbf were looking at events that happen shortly after jinxs attack im not surprised things are moving fast and hectically the slower pace and further character development might come later in the season",
        "maybe but i actually like it theyve set up so many balls in the air im interested in seeing how each one will and\n\nim liking that this season is more ambitious the knock for me would be that the writing was pretty hamfisted and generic in se but i actually really enjoy the breakneck cadence",
        "characters dont have time to breathe and develop isnt a hot take just kinda missing the point the characters for one are developing clearly and secondly look at how season  begins with jinx drowning or the grey ravaging the breathable air in the under city this all is intentional these characters dont have the luxury of breathing sometimes literally sometimes metaphorically sometimes both \n\nand i for one like this pace coming off of the first season it makes sense a lot of episodes s of season s are usually too slow",
        "those zaunites arent going to gas themselves are they",
        "for a death squad they sure didnt kill many people",
        "we prefer liberating peace squad",
        "i was looking for the same as well",
        "there will  be one the only question is how long it will be",
        "he mightve had a similar device before and just added it to his hammer",
        "arcane has always been like that to me save for s act which is more tame i kinda accepted that i need to watch some episodes a few times before i really grasp all of it",
        "i am very optimistic that it will end well this is truly some of the greatest cinema i think we will experience in our lifetime",
        "im liking it so far and i think the visuals are amazing but i for sure agree that the pacing has turned from merely rapid which i liked about s to frenetic to the point where its actively hard to keep up in places \n\nfun fact every single chembaron other than sevika is shown dying in this first act did you catch them all because this entire subplot is now resolved and most of it happened in quick onetime insert shots or in the middle of montages\n\ni like what im seeing but this is just unreasonably fast and i think it mostly reads as dropped plot threads if you cant parse the relevant shots in the short time they are shown on screen likewise with character arcs\n\nthis season so far has a very everything everywhere all at once vibe to it which is a film i really dig but in eeaao the overwhelmingness of some of the set pieces was very much the point because its from evelyns pov and she is feeling overwhelmed by life and her responsibilities but here in arcane s there are sequences that seem to unfold at a pretty normal pace for the characters instory but are superabbreviated for the viewers\n\ni vibe with what the creators are saying about trying to keep the pace brisk and it makes sense especially for an animated show where every second counts but putting  seasons worth of plot into  season worth of footage makes for a pretty jarring experience especially since unlike s where scenes did at least seem to be sequenced in mostly chronological order s so far seems a lot more nonlinear with us getting backfilled on the how we got here after we see the consequences nonlinear storytelling is fun when the scenes unfold at a normal more leisurely pace because its a bit more for the viewer to figure out and stay engaged but when everything is moving superfast already its just adding to the confusion",
        "i support womens rights but i also support womens wrongs",
        "i watched that whole fight scene just laughing at the audacity i knew we were going to get the equivalent of a jackpot by the end but dang",
        "hi ambessa",
        "basically in her world only violets are colorful so only vi can get through to her  matters to her anymore ig and when she fights jinx she sees violets",
        "i hadnt thought of that but youre right its also a mistake that we dont see how much the zaunites are suffering because of the grey",
        "yes im struggling with this so much thats why i feel like if theyre going this route we needed more time on vi and caits relationship something to show that vi so deeply cares about caitovercome with guiltis filling her loss of powder with cait that she could even make a decision like this",
        "a lot of vis decisions this season seem out of character theres no universe where she would not only become a cop but also unleash a toxic gas on her own people just to smoke jinx out",
        "i loved her character design absolutely gorgeous but shes probably going to die caught in the middle of everything going on with the black rose if we see her again",
        "she was an absolute diva im in love with her design and voice i cant find her va anywhere online maybe when the next act drops",
        "her voice actress is eve lindley",
        "shes a kiramman she does whatever she wants  marcus",
        "she decorated herself",
        "shes decorated with money and privilege baby",
        "i think theyre trying to replicate the dynasties  dystopias moment in every episode now maybe its a bit too much",
        "yes thank you i was saying this the ekko vs jinx music fight segment was so special and cool because it was a rare but cool way to show an emotional fight in season  but season  by ep  during the vi and jinx fight i was starting to think is every single big fight scene going to be a music video i really am not digging this season being a glorified music video hoping more of the big fight scenes can be more raw then queue unofficial music video",
        "i meanmusic videos been part of riots identity for forever now i can see how they can come across as too much but im into it pretty sure its gonna be every ep lol",
        "agree\n\ni like the season so far but the music videos sequences with onthenose lyrics are really giving cw teen drama vibes",
        "there are two great montages last two episodes but the first few were too much they were good but come on it hinders the show a bit",
        "i found it interesting that his conscience takes the form of sky did some of her essence actually get absorbed into the hexcore or can that magic manipulate viktor through his grief im very curious about where his storyline will go",
        "yeah i agree with you i mean viktors behavior definetely changed when he woke up i think he is being changed by the fact that he can see the arcane like it was now part of him well see where this goes",
        "i think viktor is being set up to sacrifice himself in the end to repair the relationship with the arcane and its a slow start\n\nin general i have the feeling the show has too many characters for that little bit of time each episode now to many storylines",
        "i dont think viktors story is supposed to be fully or even partly understood yet think about it  \n\nall we know is \n\n he got reanimated by the hexcore which is made from the same stuff that goes apeshit at the end of episode \n\n reminder this hexcore looked extremely corrupted and killed sky apparently randomly my memory on that scene is fuzzy clearly this is at the very least a chaotic entity and not an entirely good entity\n\n viktor wakes up changed but not aware andor understanding of how he changed his comment about not believing without certainty that cold was the right word for what he felt this to me implies that the hexcore still has power over him much like you wouldnt necessarily tell everything you know to an asset you see as a pawn\n\n we also know from league that viktor eventually comes to believe in the revolution of transforming humans into machines which is what we see in his last scene when he hallucinates sky cheering him on when he heals the cripple dude\n\nso essentially my theory  the hexcore itself is more or less pure chaos and absorbs some part of everything it touches or consumes i remember it reacted to sky as she walked in so maybe its like a virus that wants to propagate or otherwise interact with other beings i also seem to remember that sky either had some physicallypsychologically healing effect on people around her andor that she loved viktor this could even be what allowed the hexcore to revive viktor we do hear her voice when he wakes up or just write it up to its chaos magic shut up or some other unknown that will be revealed later\n\nbut keeping with my sky gives the hexcore a healing ability theory im thinking that this property interacts with the hexcores chaotic will to spreadpropagate to create the viktor as we saw him  a messiatic healer that spreads whatever healed viktor to others i expect that sooner or later everyone that got healed will either become somehow mindcontrolled brainwashed or figuratively fucked in some way that benefits the hexcore assuming it has a will",
        "viktors behavior being eerie is kinda the point i think his word to jayce were supposed to be an angry accusation but his tone and expression remained blank during the whole conversation his merging with the hexcore made him loose touch with his humanity so he feels off for sure but im really invested in seeing where this will lead",
        "im glad we got a happy ending",
        "it helps that piltover politics are incredibly dumb a foreign general from an incredibly unpopular empire can swoop in and tell everyone what to do and nobody waits for their government to make the call",
        "the different artstyle scenes are honestly the peak moments of this season so far for me",
        "im mildly surprised there was anyone rooting for him to make it \n\nhes a lot more interesting this season though",
        "the trauma wasnt there in the same way as in s act  but i definitely felt emotionally invested to the same degree in a different way\n\n\nthat way happened to be an incredible stomachturning dread at how dark a turn things have taken",
        "the season ends in a big pyjama party",
        "she doesnt actually have any formal power yet anyway and her schemes are all under the table she is however a foreign warlord and general who happens to have brought a sizeable contingent of actual soldiers to a merchant citystate whose idea of warfare is cops in riot gear\n\nall she does is speechify about how shes willing to graciously let caitlyn take command of said soldiers who are hers not the citys in piltovers time of need that will conveniently make said soldiers not just her personal guard and thus mostly confined to bodyguarding her and staying at the medarda estate but give them free run of the city\n\ntldr so far shes really just a visiting foreign dignitary with an outsized guard but shes setting up for an actual coup",
        "idk i feel like the pacing is appropriate we are at war you dont get many quiet moments  you only get the brief ones like those short pauses to the action between vi and cait sevika and jinx talking etc but again we are at war  i feel like if we got these long stretches of quiet that would not really fit this well\n\ni do hope we get more of those moments in later arcs but for now it feels fine im also not sure what you mean by the characters all feel completely different do they not that i noticed but id love some examples",
        "christian linke the creator of the show said in an interview that every character is becoming the opposite of who they were in season  doesnt excuse the bad writing but thats something he said",
        "this is what i hope ambessa will be for this season",
        "they encountered caitlyn and vi smeech and his gang were the ones that told them where jinx was",
        "yup the fact that she didnt die would be huge plot armor  i have to admit i fell for it thinking arcane writers slipped but nope very happy when i learned it was ambessa who was behind it that makes so much sense as she definitely does not want to kill her own daughter",
        "my presumption is vis sense of self is going to be put to the test this season but well have to see caitlyns shadowcrown was more on point",
        "i have some similar thoughts  this act felt pretty fast paced to me to the point where it felt like pivotal character moments were being sped through in order to set up what presumably will be the meat of the story in acts  or \n\ncait and vis kiss ekko and jayce discovering the corruption of the arcane the fight between jinx and vi caits character shift viktor leaving jayce after just a few sentences to go become fissuresjesus  heimerdingers return it all felt a bit rushed  many of these moments deserved time to breathe particularly after the building tension from last season\n\nfor example caits impatience and hyperfixation on revenge is something that makes sense on paper but it came off as abrupt and rushed onscreen  particularly at the end when she almost shoots at a child despite promising vi just a couple of minutes earlier that she wouldnt change as a person  this could have been fixed by showing a more gradual build up to caits frustrations during the search for jinx  perhaps by having the strike team spend the better part of an episode running into dead ends while investigating the undercity looking for jinx  perhaps with each new dead end cait grows increasingly more agitated feeling like jinx is always one step ahead and that her change to avenge her mother is slowly slipping away from her this would have made her desperation to kill jinx once they finally do find her a lot more organic\n\ninstead what we are given is a stylized musical montage depicting the strike teams time flushing out criminals in the fissures  and sure the music is good and the art is phenomenal but the sequence felt extremely rushed and did a poor job of conveying time  based on later comments by other characters i get the sense that were supposed to believe that cait and vi have spent several days looking for jinx to no avail but it only felt like they were down there for maybe a few hours to a day  ultimately it makes caits mood change and her coldness to vi seem abrupt when i think a major character shift like that warranted a bit more time in the oven  hell we literally go from seeing them share a kiss to cait turning against vi entirely in a matter of minutes\n\nthis is just one example but i could give similar analyses for many other moments  i hope that things slow down a tad in the next act so we get a bit more time to marinate in the characters feelings and motivations\n\nnone of this is to say that the episodes were bad of course  but they just felt a bit off given the extremely high quality this show has me accustomed to i actually disagree with your take on s act  and think all  acts of s were perfectly paced but thats a debate for another day lol",
        "its lacking nuance",
        "her parents were specifically killed by enforcers like cait and now herself which is a little different when she and jayce went rouge that time here she already feels like she became the monster she was supposed to fight against and then the kid specifically jumped in to protect jinx her parental figure which is something vi can deeply relate she probably saw her younger self in that kid\n\nbut you are also right i doubt in her conscience she isnt totally okay with killing her sister no matter how many times she says powder is dead",
        "i agree that deep down she doesnt actually want to strike that killing blow it felt like she was stalling before isha even jumped in but also look at vis face in that scene in se where she talks to at jayce shes not nearly as indifferent as she plays it off plus theres a pretty big difference between accidentally killing an undercity kid and willingly risking their death",
        "yes and no i definitely think that her true reason for stopping cait was that she realized she couldnt let jinx die afterall if it was just ishas presence she could have moved her out of the way she tried to convince herself that her sister was dead but seeing her protecting isha reminded her of their own relationship but theres also the fact that the kid jayces killed was well already dead it was an accident she didnt get the opporuntiy to stop him in time and  jayce was far more horrified than she was so she tried to justify it as something that just happened time to move on\n\nin caits case the shot wasnt fired yet but cait kept her weapon aimed in the direction of a child it was a step too far from what vi was able to take from someone she loves",
        "i think most people understand that calling her hitler isnt to make an actual comparison between them its just a shorthand for dictator of a military state",
        "ikr it could do with more atmospheric music instead of the weird pop music nothing against the music itself but it makes some scenes feel like an edit",
        "we all knew she did it but the reveal just felt so hamfisted\n\nbased on many youtube reactions it seems the reveal was needed",
        "you will be surprised at the amount of people who didnt know that",
        "i disagree i cant stop listening to ashes and blood and trough this song i continuosly reviving the scenes again and again i think this is hiting me more than the first temp just the songs",
        "believe it or not a full military movement is pretty much the best solution when half of your countrys ruler get bombed by terrorists",
        "literally hitler calling someone hitler has completely lost all meaning basically on the same tier as calling someone a meanie",
        "lmao i thought she was just drunk when she was doing that",
        "and despite ambessa beign seen as smart she kinda really fucked up with whatever happened with the black rose  \nsilco actually knew when to play calm at least for the most part as mel says she seems desperate which i get as characterisation but i feel like as a villain it just makes her a bit uninteresting in general her being an outside influence to piltover and zaun makes her inclusion a bit wonky and does not help with the emotional groundwork the story needs  \nthe tragedy of piltover and zaun is that they are one people but ambessa is not it just lessens the impact of all the terrible things that continue to happen",
        "proof that salo was abusing shimmer",
        "she basically quickscoped that shot too if i remember right",
        "your initial take was right the tiktok people are going off the deep end",
        "i mean cynically its pretty easy for the writers to let jinx get away with what she did to cait and her mom last season if they just make cait go so far in her quest for revenge that her arc demands that she forgives or lets jinx go",
        "planification and charisma he was the man with the vision enough for sevika to pledge her loyalty to him and acts as his errand girl she complains that she had to do all the grunt work but if shed wanted to overthrow silco she absolutely could have she just believed in his ability to rally zaun better than she could herself",
        "the thing about ambessa is she is already super influential because shes from noxus a stronger military based nation and shes apparently a high up figure from noxus as well\n\nthey implied this with mels position in the council from s why would some kid banished from noxus be able to join the piltover council apart from heimerdinger all other council members are from importantold families\n\nadditionally ambessa was the one who sent mel to piltover so we can assume she or by extension noxus has enough power that mel as a foreigner would even be on the council\n\nambessa isnt mels mom mel is ambessa medardas daughter ambessa is the one who is powerful and influential in their family\n\nre the wild rune stuff well i think if you have played the game and know the characters powers it doesnt seem so out there and is actually a logical progression of the hexcore evolution however it will depend on how well act  and act  shows the development and how it links to the other characters and their growth",
        "agreed actually the montages are the weirdest part of the season liking it overall and im sure the next two acts will be great since this one was more setup but it feels really odd that most of the musical scenes have been in this weird animatic style whereas i remember all of ss being properly animated",
        "there is a line from vi justifying the use of the grey when jinx confronts her along the lines of just being used against the bad guys that said i agree with you\n\npart of what makes the use of the grey illustrative of caitlyns dark turn is how cruel and perverse it is to directly weaponize the pollution that is emblematic of the neglect and exploitation the undercity has experienced under the reign of piltover not to mention ironically a hazard her mother apparently tried to alleviate out of mercy\n\nvis whole life shes been acutely aware of the neglect and exploitation her home has faced her perspective on their use of the grey really needed some more exploration on her end",
        "i agree its all moving at breakneck pace and feels overstuffed like theyre trying to cram  or  episodes worth of plot into every ep to the point where even what feels like big plot points like the last  chembarons standing being taken out by caitlyns strike force is taken care of by a single blinkandyoullmissit shot in the middle of a montage\n\nthat said i dont think this is ooc for vi because its the confluence of two traits she has displayed pretty consistently through all of s she will do and excuse pretty much anything when it comes to people she considers family and she is pretty callous about violence and killing because to her its just a fact of life and she repeatedly chooses not to examine it\n\nremember this is the same person whose response to her yo sister trying to build frickin nail bombs boiled down to you go girl i think the specific thing that changed for vi during the attack was not that she suddenly cares whether the pilties feel safe or not i fully believe she does not its that caitlyn is from that point forward dead set on going whether vi comes along or not that plus vi seeing cait almost die twice during the attack is what i think moves vi to tag along but with something that pivotal i want to see that decision happen not just the implication that it happened offscreen\n\nall that said its also made pretty clear especially in e that vis toughgirl persona is an act we see her tell caitlyn that powder is dead and later in e handwave away the use of the grey but she is visibly upset every time merciless cait comes out and when it comes down to it she is ok with neither killing jinx herself nor risking a childs life by letting caitlyn take her shot\n\nin other words i dont think shes convinced at all she is lying to cait and probably herself to get to come along definitely to protect cait and probably also even if she doesnt admit it to herself to get another chance to get close to jinx ultimately vi is all about trying to protect whomever she considers family and has no idea what to do with herself if she doesnt get to do that",
        "she went from i still hate enforcers with every fiber of my being\n\nher initial refusal was more reluctant than that imo she is a far cry from early s vi and she feels a pretty strong obligation towards cait after her mother died\n\neven when shes talking to cait after the attack she kind of brushes it off\n\ncait straight up says either her or jinx will die if she goes in alone vi nervously joked about thinking cait would die in the fight before she rescued her \n\ntheres also the question of the gauntlets  vi wanted them back to deal with jinx and id say her interactions with maddie and the other enforcers are also important theyre friendly and at the end of the day theyre who vi is going to work with she has a badge but its not like shes working at some police station shes following cait and working with a small squad of nice enforcers",
        "i saw another post that really made me think about this it said that the price of cassandras coffin itself was probably more than a house in zaun that plus the whole funeral meanwhile jinx had to let silco sink to the bottom of a river zaunites dont get the privilege of sending off their dead loved ones",
        "shed already missed one shot her gun was still a lil unstable she was extremely emotionally chargedunstable she was shooting impulsively evidenced by the fact she wasnt taking her signature deep breath to calm down before shooting had an obviously manic facial expression and wasnt thinking tactically jinx was pinned down she shouldve gone after sevika or the kid obviously without killing the kid and dealt with jinx later while defending vi",
        "its not important if she would or not i think the point is that she loses herself in the first episode she is worried about casualties and innocent people being hurt obviously in the third episode she doesnt care and vi is worried",
        "vi was using that as a reasonexcuse to protect her sisterjinx",
        "yes bro they were extremely amped up after the rune explosion and she couldnt control it she was missing already and thats why vi got worried as fuck",
        "was it the trigger finger since when do you pull the trigger with your middle finger",
        "the subtle color shifting in them is really entrancing to watch in those close up shots",
        "that was the best part of this act viktor healing huck was such a powerful moment",
        "totally lol",
        "i was blown away by how stylish it is it feels like a graphic novel and i personally love it",
        "i loved that each episode opens with a musical montage some even being in the fight scenes they are some of the scenes were the animation and direction gets most creative and stylish",
        "thats our freaking boy right there",
        "and clearly hes the only one who should be entrusted with stealth missions",
        "somewhat ironic considering his game powerset",
        "im glad shes grateful but id be pissed being given a randomizer weapon tbh fits jynxs character though",
        "she definitely has powers when the dude pistol whipped her on stage the exact same effect as the season finale was happening",
        "in the ambessa music video they show her pregnant with mel and the embryos eyes glow yellow",
        "i assume it has something to do with why she and jayce werent injured by the explosion",
        "nice catch",
        "could you tell me what timestamp that was exactly im looking for it and cant notice anything",
        "in zaun theyre eating the dogs theyre eating the cats theyre eating the pets",
        "president kiramman",
        "she has been saying some seriously unnerving phrases that dehumanizes zaun calling them animals and such even saying that i thought you were different to vi says a lot",
        "shes a wind spirit and the people of zaun pray to her for clean air so they could breath",
        "shes an ancient deity that became so legendary shes a childs story by now",
        "ah i put myself on a teaser diet after the first couple thanks for the explanation that makes way more sense than the scene not landing",
        "fist to chest thump",
        "im so curious to find out what ambessas motive is\n\ni feel like it is pretty straightforward her familys enemies are winning so she is seeking power wherever she can she is pushing to gain political control in piltover and also getting jayce to fully weaponize hextech \n\nshe basically wants to have all of her soldiers equipped with hextech weapons and use them to beat her enemies and potentially do it with the support of piltovers dictator",
        "shes after something to do with the hex right maybe a weapon to overpower her oppressors back home",
        "this is worse we cant blame shitty writing here",
        "same man same",
        "same here i already have so many from season  as backgrounds that cycle through on my computer i cant wait to add so many from this season\n\nthe memorial scenes in the first episode with the greyblack were almost distracting me because i loved how they looked also when they turned it into a comic book style was great i love the art design of this show so much",
        "i know i know but maybe we could at least get something resembling a whimsical montage before the end",
        "miming pull the thing",
        "on par with the excellent ekko vs jinx bridge fight from s",
        "they were basically stormtroopers using chemical warfare on civilians and insurgents its deep war crime level activities",
        "i mean between that and piltover invading it seems a little less  enphasis on the little  macabre but yeah kind of unhinged anyways im giving her some room because it almost worked and if it had this whole thing couldve been avoided",
        "the show made it a point that the gangsters at margots place stayed alive although its obviously going to have pretty bad health consequences viktors disease is a side effect of childhood exposure after all",
        "yeah i like that interpretation i didnt consider the i created this monster side but thats a good point and super sad it all harkens back to her being static in season one shes basically the same person with more trauma from pre and post time skip\n\nas to her next steps its definitely not a surprise for someone who grew up in prison to be lost she has no home anymore and the one goal she used to survive stillwater saving her sister fell apart spectacularly now caitlyns gone off the rails and vi probably has zero coping skills no support network and zero selfworth the most interesting part will be if as you say she finds a way to grow despite all that\n\ni really hope she gets some kind of happy ending",
        "so much vengeance in her heart im surprises a certain spear thrower hasnt showed up lol",
        "this people are fine when the common people rise up but its a completely different story when the privileged descend",
        "the amount of leeway given to jinx is honestly wild to me",
        "for a group whos completely terrorized piltover multiple times in a span of a weeks its wild how anyone can think the topsiders are being too wild here",
        "agree with this all and imo vi deciding to become an enforcer",
        "i agree with this i just rewatched se yesterday and the pacing felt good to me i thought it flowed together well enough",
        "yeah honestly this feels way more like season  act  than season  act \n\nwhich tbh i kinda like",
        "so many questions and jinx just suddenly doesnt have flashbacks either i mean i understand the situation triggered her more having being re exposed to past and present feeling memories and verizon of herself but for that to suddenly just stop and for her now to be completely buddy buddy with i forgot her name ssomething i dont mind them becoming friends it makes sense but that has to grow",
        "this is true but i wish it was verbalized more clearly there should have been a moment to recognize their previous beef but then realize that the corruptionarcane requires more of their attention as is its super jarring that these characters have nothing to say to each other than lets do science bro",
        "she will be able to direct her anger and manipulate her that way for quite a while i dont know how long the time jump is going to be between act  and  but i could see anything from  months to  years\n\ncait will come out of it at some point and then ambessa will realise shes not so easily controlled when she doesnt want to be",
        "theres something different about him when they woke up in the morning after drinking he wasnt actually hung over as much as he seemed he was hamming it up you can catch him letting it drop for a moment before they leave i dont think he is really just some nameless grunt",
        "somehow the way they met made me think he was homeless and not an enforcer oops",
        "yes i noticed that immediately and literally gasped out loud that close up shot of vis face with tears in her eyes felt similar to the shot of powders face when she started crying and then vi was on her knees in the same way that powder was too",
        "honestly thats a big part of it i feel like the mv scenes in the first season were fitted in well and smart they told a story every time it happened now i was like  i have no clue whats happening i watched it together with my partner and we spent half the time going whos that what huh why and even at the end of episode  we were like we just watched  hours and like so much has happened but also  nothing at all",
        "yeah in season one they also existed but they felt appropriate eg the jinxekkofight is basically a music video but there its used as a flashback and a flash forward the former used to recontextualise and explain the two characters relationship and how they have or havent changed the latter hinting at ekkos future abilities\n\nin this season it just felt random and the fight scenes were not really fluid",
        "amara also was pretty vague with we know what youre chasing in pilltover",
        "yes but isnt the whole purpose of her coming to piltover to get the hextech weapons to fight off the black rose\n\n she needs jayce yes she also needs to influence a lot of different people including caytlin and manipulate them so they themselves force jayce to make the weapons but ultimately its him who makes them no one else is going to replace him",
        "true i was hoping for something a bit more badass tho",
        "be quiet this cant end it wont end it wont end",
        "but the thing is mel is her biological daughter ambessa might have taken something of black rose when mel was in her because mel has special powers as seen in ambessas music video so there is no way mel was taken from someone else but powers could have been",
        "im sure they are all hit singles but when you keep throwing them in instead of the usual usual instrumentals youre splitting the focus and making this look more like a music video than an episode are they trying to sell bands and music or what",
        "noticed those artistic abstractstyle moments too they look nice but i think they go too far as a visual metaphor especially because they depict a realityaltering visual effect in an otherwise grounded scene which is a visual effect already caused by magical sources ie midend of ep makes those moments where magic turns reality into the abstract stand out a little less if they keep doing it whenever",
        "i dunno it felt like season s music video segments felt more earned i guess these feel somehow more conspicuous possibly because theyre immediately after the opening credits and not usually at the end of an episode",
        "episode  might be not long after jimxs attack but they skip through time so fast it too hard to keep track of what time frame it is after that",
        "its strangely fast and slow at the same time\u00a0 the plot is packing in a lot of story very quickly but the pacing feels glacial",

        "the way i see it jayce killing the herald is him fulfilling his promise to viktor in season  before viktor fully fused with the hexcore in s and became the herald the bit of humanity that remained within him understood the danger and in his last act as viktor he asked jayce to destroy the hexcore     \n  \nafter the attack on the council jayce feared losing his friend and broke his promise instead using the hexcore to heal him and in doing do erasing the last remnants of viktors humanity jayces time trapped in the arcane likely traumatized him yes but it gave him the perspective he needed and allowed him to do what viktor wanted him to do in the first place to destroy the hexcore and let viktor die there is no overlooking the symbolism around this act \n\n he finds the herald strung up inside of the sphere representing viktor trapped within the control of the hexcore\n the community that the herald has created is meant to unsettle its too devout too unnatural it is meant to instill a sense of unease the herald has helped these people yes but look what happens when he dies the veneer slips away and reveals the horror of meddling with these powers\n the gear representing the two sides of viktors descent humanity vs arcane it is shown countless times throughout viktors descent as he slips further and further away it is meant as a warning\n finally jayces bracelet how he clung to his dream of the hextech after it saved him as a child and now the gem is fused to his skin as he can no longer escape his failures from his pursuit of it",

        "was that deckards head in singeds lab",
        "damn i really wish there had been a rd season planned that transition from act  to act  felt super abrupt im  still enjoying it but i feel like a couple of these stories needed just a tiny bit more time to cook that a rd season could have provided eg caitlyns tyrant arc resolves almost instantly warwicks vander reveal felt too fast all that said the scene with warwick tearing through the prison to doom music was awesome and viktors death and the resulting fallout jayce what the fuck are you doing was fucking crazy",
        "i loved it but damn really feeling the brisk pacing in a way i wasnt in act  wouldve loved to see caitlyns slide back out of anger and into reason in the  show rather than skipping right into it also the lack of a major reaction to jinx in episode  was a bummer\ni get it though theres limited time and caitlyn really got the majority of development in act \n\niuuuiuggghhhh jinx talking to silcos empty chair emotional damage sooooooooo excited to see what the hell happened to jayce to turn him into this traumatized soldier who squished his best friend without hesitation i dont know a single thing about league lore so i am so seated for the other shoe to drop about viktors healing",
        "i hope the next act covers what exactly what went down in the arcane the show is incredibly fast paced though and it does hurt some key moments like caits change up although it was obvious and the black rose sub plot there is so much to happen in the last three episodes i do hope we get a satisfying act to finish the series up because so far it has been glorious",
        "it shouldve been a three season show wayyy too much is happening i get theres three episodes left but i dont think they have enough time to wrap everything up without things feeling rushed \n\ni also wish they wouldve just focused on the piltoverzaun stuff the rest of it is like being on acid i get that its part of the games which ive never played but i know theyre planning on making more shows in the arcane universe and maybe those plotlines couldve been pushed more towards those shows im not saying to get rid of the plot entirely but having everything seems too overambitious",
        "didnt expect vi and jinx to have a make up of any kind after arcane  but even if it ends up being only temporary im very glad they did\n\nfinding out the reason singed has done everything hes ever done is for his daughter is also crazy\n\nso much to take in cant wait for the last three episodes",

        "after seeing all his followers die as soon as he died it seems like viktor wasnt really healing anybody but just creating copies of himself using other peoples bodies",
        "guys i cant stand twitter hating on jayce cause i truly believe he did that for a reason he thought would worth it he saw something we couldnt  being trapped on the savage arcane he might have seen a lot we didnt \n\nplus viktor said jayce should have destroyed the hextec before leaving him on the st episode so yeah\n\nguess thats my man and imma stick beside him",

        "lowkey wish caitlyn corruption arc lasted longer than just seeing vi once and immediately flipping back i found the ambessacait relationship fascinating and i wish we had longer to develop the small intricacies in the relationships and allow time for the plot to breathe a bit",
        "maybe ill get downvoted for this but the writing of this season hasnt been nearly as tight as season  i can practically feel the writers straining to cut their plans down to nine  minute episodes you can really tell how much they had to cut based on how scattered some of this seems\n\neverything is moving so fast we dont have any room to breathe or drink in the emotional impact of what were seeing cait and vi working together again after what happened couldve used a couple extra minutes of dialogue the vipowdervander reunion couldve used some more context and an extra scene  it was still good dont get me wrong  it just doesnt match the weight of season s best moments\n\nalso killing off isha is such a ridiculously low blow that only got played for shock value im sorry i hope shes not dead and that im proven wrong eventually but killing off kids or petsanimals in media is always an obnoxiously cheap way of hurting your audience she couldve been more than a plotdevice\n\nheimer and ekko not being around this act either really sucks theyve only gotten like  what  or  scenes so far how are they gonna have any impact in act  the same thing happened in season  ekko kind of got snubbed of any actual development back then and sure his fight with jinx was incredible but its doing so much heavy lifting where some extra context wouldve been awesome\n\ni think they bit off way more than they could chew with all these intertwining plot lines theres simply too much going on and they dont have enough time to give each story the attention it deserves\n\nshouldve been  seasons or at the very least the seasons shouldve been longer than  episodes",

        "when isha was first introduced i thought it was going to be quite on the nose how much she reminded jinx of powder but man they did a great job on fleshing out their relationship in those episodes seeing isha do all the same things powder did must have made jinx realize on some level how pointless it is to hate herself for her own actions when she was ishas age shes just a kid shes trying her best its the embodiment of what would you want your younger self to hear this show is fucked up in all the best ways and i will be sobbing into next week",
        "how tf are they going to finish all these plot lines up in three episodes",
        "this may be a stupid question but what exactly was the goal of ishas stunt she aimed at vander and almost certainly died in the process but how does that help jinx and the rest assuming she succeeds vander dies not good isha dies also not good the noxians can now freely take the immobilizeddead vander and continue their experiments also not good like yeah maybe it made it slightly easier for her friends to escape amidst all the chaos but there must have been other ways of achieving that",
        "after s act  it makes sense to me why maddie loris and steb appear in the story notice all three appear at the same time to vi including loris pretending to sleep but paying attention to vi and maddies conversation\n\nlater we see maddie beating her chest motivating caitlyn to accept her role as commander and then becoming her lover we also see loris tagging along with vi during her brawls and boozefilled nights\n\nwhat am i getting at all three are trained so much so that they participated in the elite troop to me they were purposefully placed to accompany caitlyn and vi in their search for jinx to keep tabs on them with the failure of the mission and the separation of the couple maddie took care of caitlyn and loris of vi so that they kept the two away from each other and encouraged vis downfall and caitlyns indoctrination by ambessa\n\nloris is a mystery to me because he is so observant again the scene when he meets vi and the scene where he observes caits nervous hands in the piltover elite meeting i do not yet know if he is good or bad but he didnt try to stop vi from her downfall\n\nto whom does this interest if loris and maddie are together i bet they are working for ambessa herself the serpent wellwe will discover if it is true or not in the final act\n\nandoh boy what a series this second act was so touching to my heart",

        "i absolutely love this show but it feels like we are just zooming past some plots its like we dont have any time to breathe i wouldve loved to seen more of ekkoheimer jayces time in there viktor the black rosemels powers etc a  episode season wouldve been perfect i think i wonder how nonleague players feel about this season",

        "my coping mask is well and truly on but i think the theory is true the last scene froze as the bomb exploded and the sound effect was very reminiscent of a certain time guy we havent seen in a bit why else would they just freeze an explosion mid boom \n\neverything these talented animators do is with purpose soo in conclusion \nhappy endings still on at least thats what im choosing to believe for the next week",

        "anyone noticed how young silcos hair looked incredibly similar to jinxs",
        "man sometimes i feel that i am watching a different show than other people \n\nthis whole maddie thing has me confused like i watched those scenes and saw cait mostly just going through the motions she doesnt hate maddie or anything but the affection was strongly coming from maddie and not much from cait like there was even a part where maddie starts  to kiss her neck and cait pulls away then the only other scene is them briefly talking about how jinx has been inactive \n\ncait then meets back up with vi and within like  seconds is already back to bantering with her tar hair \n\nlike just compare how passionate cait is with vi in the act  kiss there is nothing even close to that with maddie and she has likely been in a relationship with maddie longer than she was with vi at that point \n\nlike the comparisons in how she acts with the two to me makes it clear how much more she care for vi yet i read comments about how because cait isnt drinking herself to death and hallucinating about vi it means she doesnt care for her just because vi should probably be in therapy doesnt mean cait coping with a rebound girl sorry maddie shows a lack of care  \n\nneither does the fact that we didnt explicitly see her missing vi riot showed two different approaches we see vi explicitly missing cait through hallucination because she has no one else cait is trying to have someone else but we see through her actions that it isnt the same both of these are valid and imo fit the characters and how they would react based on what happened cait is in the wrong and trying to distract herself vi is hurt from the betrayal  \n\nother than a general complaint of i just wish we had more i think my only complaint will be is if we dont see cait strongly apologize in act  assuming it ends with them together i will be upset if vi is somehow the one who is made to feel that they need to apologize",
        "people hating on jayce have lost the plot fr",
        "after watching this block of episodes i keep going back to the first three this season hasnt quite hit like the first for me personally and my biggest gripe is the lack of character development for the new characters i think it would have been a much stronger start if jinx wasnt in the first episodes at all and the first arc was focused on caitlyns squad and isha chasing rumors and looking for her   \n  \nand its clear that isha was added because the writers couldnt figure out a way for jinx to give a shit about zaun shes such a sloppy narrative device",
        "why is no one talking about how fine jayce s is\n\ni know we hate him rn but like",
        "isnt that strange that vi never mentioned ekko after the reunion last time she saw him he fought jinx and literally couldve died wasnt he supposed to be their childhood friend",
        "why do they have a family reunion just for it to go to shit in the same episode whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy they gonna make poor vander die twice and ishhhaaaaa whyyy",
        "what was even the point of this character",
        "is it only me who is thoroughly disappointed by act ii felt like they undid all that was established in the first act my biggest issue is caitlyn who is one of my favourite characters whos character arc i love as much as jinxs and who is in some extremely implausible way my wife i did not understand how her descent into enraged revenge arc which was already kind of over the top in act i got completely sidetracked from scene  of episode  i also find her sleeping with maddie unnecessary also her reaction to vi even with the cute disgruntled married couple banter and especially her reaction to jinx is so unnatural i also did not like vi and jinx getting back together so quickly maybe they are rushing the show to finish it up quickly but im a little sad about all this\n\n  \nalso im pissed off that caitlyn decides to save vander after such a quick conversation with vi i mean he like broke apart a dozen enforcers you know vi is hot sure but at this point geez cait maybe go find someone with a less dysfunctional family\n\nalso this is my first ever post on reddit yay does anyone want to fight me for caitlyns hand in marriage",
        "all the jayce haters need to take a chill pill the dude clearly is able to see something through viktors facade that others cannot hell viktor literally is literally putting on a mask in the shows intro the dudes intentions may have been pure but as weve already seen out of viktor before your intentions to do great things can ultimately do more harm in the end it wouldnt be the first time that a work of fiction has done the super genius creates a utopia that ultimately stamps out everything it means to be human type story line the writers clearly want you to see viktor as a force of absolute good at this point in act  that we will almost certainly learn his vision wasnt as great as we are lead to believe",
        "im noticing a bit of a pacing issue feels like were missing some inbetween episodes to flesh things out more\n\nmost of all im asking myself when exactly did jinxx become a symbol of the people when we left off in act  she was still hated and seen as an outcast by most\n\nthere seems to have been a timeskip but it the detailsdevelopments have mostly be offscreened\n\nit still has the hear where it counts but i dont think this has been as airtight narritvely as season  so far nonetheless im still having a blast",
        "my theory is that jayce saw viktor either through the rune visions or in an alternate universe where viktor becomes evil and tries to take over the world or something similar this leads jayce to try and stop viktor in the real world but his actions ironically cause it to happen its a selffulfilling prophecy viktors discussions about fate and destiny introduce themes of prophecy",
        "ngl caitlyns story feels all over the place it feels like the writers wanted to have a villain arc but then proceeded to immediately change her to be buddies with vi again after  reflection of her actions like you cant tell me she went from willing to kill a kid in order to kill jinx to being neutral with her just because",
        "now that ive finally run out of tears here are my thoughts on act  wall of text incoming\n\n a lot of people have issues with the pacing i think its noticable but doesnt hold the story back for me all the plotpoints and characters work and even though i would love to spend more time on everything in this world i think its better to rush a great story than to drag it out that being said i am a little worried how they are gonna resolve everything in just  episodes i have no doubt its gonna be good but this show deserves a perfect ending\n\n my jaw hit the floor when i saw cait and maddie in bed together my exact thought was i seem to have underesimated you maddie respect i do feel kinda bad for her though cause cait clearly has no deeper feelings for her and is using her to fill the emptiness left by vi\n\n jinx and isha being sisters warmed my heart seeing jinx finally have a positive relationship with somebody other than silco was just so satisfying it also makes perfect sense why she says that jinx is dead in her mind jinx was a monster who lived inside her a destructive force that ruins anything that gets close to her with silco gone she had no purpose and she wanted to die in episode  when that failed and isha became a permanent part of her life that all changed now she has somebody to live and care for to protect both from the outside world and from herself of course she wouldnt wanna be the demon of death people have come to know her with isha by her side\n\n i like caitlyns ambiguity about being a dictator in act  she was ruthless and determined to catch jinx but these were her actions based on her decisions she could justify it because of her recent trauma with her newfound power she is forced to give other people the orders she wouldve performed herself previously and she is not comfortable with that reality she would rather take down jinx by herself one justifyable act of revenge against one person not a bunch of orders to opress thousands of innocents\n\n and then theres ambessa poisoning her mind by reminding her of her mother fostering that rage inside her while assuring cait that she is in control and can stop at any time like the devil on caits shoulder pushing her to go one step further every time\n\n jinxs mental breakdown after learning isha was kidnapped was truely disturbing we saw those in season  but this one hurt more because she was stable and happy for so long only to have it ripped away again and have the voices return now including silco even sevika looked shocked by that even though she had known jinx for years now\n\n the prison brake was both hilarious and heartwarming it also shows that jinx really doesnt understand what it feels like for people to look up to you she thought everybody would cheer after that big fat hero line but when they all slowly touched her to show their gratitute she was completely overwhelmed poor girl \n\n warwick oh my fcking god that was pure horror the buildup the pov the gondola slowly approaching singed closing his cell door the gore the music the colors everything was just chefs kiss\n\n im so glad we didnt spend a lot of time on vis time as a pitfighter yes it looks awesome but there really isnt much to do with that storywise its to show her hit rock bottom and punish herself ad it achieves that anything beyond wouldve felt excessive\n\n i did not expect that jinx vi isha teamup to save vanders soul but oh my god was it good the sisters finally acting like sisters insulting and fighting without real consequences was so fun to watch\n\n the scene where the sisters break through to vander and they finally get to hug it all out was something i only expected to see in fanfictions but it was beyond emotional hes your father too augh my heart",

        "i feel viktors monologue at the end agrees with what jayce did jayce saw things and understood the two sides of the same coin that no matter how much good you do it comes at a cost and is corrupted the utopia cult couldnt last it was held together by viktor simply existing so much power and playing god hate jayce sure but it was actually a cult and they all lost their free will",

        "it is rushed im now scared if the ending will be as good as the first season",

        "this season has been edgeofyourseat stuff the whole way through theres constant action and adrenaline with an insanely interesting story \n\nthe one thing i dont understand is the producers comstantly claiming that its a  season story this could easily have been a  season show and i think the quality would be even better theyve crafted an incredibly captivating story why not give everything its due time to develop\n\nanother season couldve allowed us to stoke the fires even more in this season with some mix between further exploring the characters relationships with one another and taking more time to develop these further exploring the politics that are driving the plot forward and giving more attention to the piltover vs zaun conflict and how it is affected by the overwhelming might of noxus and giving us more time to explore the scientific questions and religious allegories tied to the arcane \n\nthis season has been incredible so far the main issue that ive seen brought up and that i share to an extent is that certain things feel like theyre happening too quickly i think a third season wouldve given the necessary time to explore everything in as much depth as it deserves whilst setting up an explosive final season\n\na structure akin to\ns largely setting up the characters action\ns setting up the looming conflict and fleshingnout the final relationships between characters action\ns all out action on the back of the tension that were built up in the previous seasons",

        "i never expected viktors and jayce arc to go the route it did but man i am loving this so much like everything they did especially with the lore of the world and viktors powers is breathtaking and while jayce turning into whatever he is now felt a little bit rushed and openended what did he see and where are heimerdinger and ekko i still think it really plays off the dynamic the two have\n\n  \nand yes the pacing is way too fast but everything else makes up for it",

        "solid act and the pacing feels a little better than in act  but i really think theres way too much going on for the time they have at this point victor jesus jayce jinxvivander mel singeambessacaitlyn plus the time skip forcing them to re establish whats going on with the world while now having to explore the arcane  mel vs the black rose her sibling and we dont even get any ekko or heim just way too many storylines going on for  episodes \n\nnot to say i didnt enjoy a lot of it i thought the jinxvivander storyline was the best by far though jinx and vi going from fighting to the death in episode  to recouping as sisters in like  onscreen minutes between the two was a bit quick another issue caused by too much story in too little time the viktor jesus storyline was alright though it took up wayy too much of  act  percentage wise like we get it viktor is some magical healer in a utopia we dont need to spend half of every episode showing that i did like how jayce came out of the rune or whatever haunted by what he helped spread throughout the world and dedicating himself to stop it and im honestly glad he succeeded the singeambessacaitlyn storyline was fine though vi suddenly trusting caitlyn again literally the first second she sees her after getting unceremoniously dumped for lack of a better description almost makes their relationship a little gross in a stockholm way at this point the mel storyline was fine i guess i never really cared for the black rose arc introduced in act  in the first place and mels intelligence and guile were always more interesting to me than her powers which is just another thing thatll take precious time to be addressed and no addressing what happened to ekkoheim in this entire act especially after explicitly showing jayces return was a little weird because for that entire jayce returns scene i was only partially paying attention while waiting for the other two to show up just for the scene to end with no mention of them \n\ni was really excited to watch how sevika tries to unite the undercity more in depth but we really only get  speech that lasts a couple of minutes one that she really wouldnt have even succeeded at by herself isha was really the tipping point to unite them all and then they got captured directly after thatand rampaged by vander soon after anyway then she runs isha out of harms way and simply disappears for the rest of the act and speaking of isha her arc and subsequent sacrifice was alright like i enjoyed her sacrifice scene and felt the adequate sadness the writers were trying to evoke but the  minute sequence of flashbacks of the couple of minutes we see of her having fun with jinx were a little ham fisted to me not to mention her death was practically spelled out in neon letters right before it happened when jinx went on about i like you well do great things together in the future i really enjoyed her interactions with jinx and wouldve loved to see more and i honestly dont really see her sacrificing herself as impactful enough to be the act  cliffhanger thatll have me counting the seconds till next week like the ending of episode  did\n\nobviously im still really enjoying the season and the high points are absolutely amazing but to boil it all down i just think theres way too much going on for only  more episodes the teaser for act  makes it look like everyones all working together to fight off ambessa and i dont really see how theyll be able to force multiple storylines together to go down that main path cohesively",

        "just here to leave an appreciation comment for episode  the way all the characters came together in the same place just to have the  of that utopia turn into a battlefield in a flash rainbows turned to single colours of red gold the repeated motif of the gearcoin how neatly it represents the macro themes of lovehumanitygood and evil on a micro scale and each time its used it matches the developing epiphany about this theme throughout the episode every frame every painting the colours the brushstrokes the lighting had my jaw on the floor the whole time as an artist i give it a standing ovation",

        "too many questions i dont understand whats happening",

        "so far act  is making me kind of question what the point of the final build up of last season was for now like the war between piltover and zaun doesnt really feel like a main conflict anymore the tension between the two sides felt so real and gripping and now it just feels really flat and without tension  \njinx feels like shes supposed to be taking over silcos place as an antagonist but she keeps flip flopping between being a leader and just sort of hanging around and then later on just kind of makes up with vi it really doesnt feel like enough time has passed for that to happen   \nlike last seasons ending made it feel like powder was gone jinx is going to carry on silcos dream and the conflict between piltover and zaun is going to be full focus and now they have me just kind of thinking what the point to it all was",
        "the hate for jayce shows how cults are so easily able to recruit people irl lol",
        "good episodes but i just cant see how they can wrap up this entire story in just three more episodes without making it feel extremely rushed\n\nalso not a fan of how everyones just cool with jinx now she was blowing up firelights last season now they see her as a hero caitlyn went from being willing to scour the undercity for her  consequences be damned  in episode  to not really having a reaction to her beyond you in episode  vi i can at least understand since its her sister even if i was hoping shed hold on to her grudge for the angst  drama thatd create",
        "i kinda feel like caits setup was wasted we get a handful of scenes of her as commander and most of the worst stuff is off screened then she just kinda realizes ambressa might be nuts off screen and changes sides again basically the moment she runs into vi\n\nfeels like they ran into the wall of time constrants and basically sacrificed the entire middle of her arc\n\notherwise very strong set",

        "these rewatches are going to be painful",
        "guys wheres ekko",
        "im rather disappointed in caitlyn arc so far like whats even the point of her dictator phase if they werent going to commit to it she just folds as soon vi ask her to save her dad which btw in her perspective just killed a bunch of people not even finding jinx bothered that much like she spend months trying to catch her with no success and she appears in front of her and the best she can muster is a annoyed you \n\nlike are were supposed to forget the months of martial law and police brutality she put zaun trough because she turned against ambessa now that she became too much of a risk after using her soldiers to enforce her will and dont come with her why is peace always the  justification for violence line because she still allowed ambessa to carry out her raid in the statue with her men without proper cause \n\nso the whole zaun revolution became pointless or its cait going to try to have her cake and it too i mean seriously if they use zaun to bail out piltover from the noxians they invited this would be so ass\n\ni hope next chapter we have actual conflict between cait vi and jinx and this is not resolved because caitvi needs to happen and they have to get along vi just proved what caitlyn accused her of she is protecting her sister now for real and i hope vi doesnt brush off cait actions the past few months mrs different",
        "i warned people most of the characters would start moving closer to their league counterparts and everyone just kept hammering the new canon drum",

        "i think its superfluous for jinx to lose her family a third time i know this is very likely setup to refocus her anger toward the big bad noxus but it feels cheap and it makes me fear that the story will be handwaving the genuine problems between piltover and zaun",
        "im not the only one who thinks the second season is developing way too quickly right everything feels rushed and abrupt this raises a question did they spend too much money and decide to cram such massive storylines into one season or was it planned this way from the start\n\nbtw i liked the first seasons storytelling more because of its pacing consistency and logic than what i see now",
        "i really thought loris knock off vander was going to play a bigger role in vis brawler arc but no he was part of one montage that we saw in the previews before fucking off what was the point of that character",
        "they realllly need to let the relevant characters speak to each other man maybe one or two fever montages or slow shots of singed walking and a bit more yknow cait and vi actually exchanging words its been months for cait to calm down sure but not for us viewers who when last we saw them saw them in conflict\n\nor a few lines between vi and jinx to explain how theyre suddenly on decent terms again  seconds spent on admittedly very cool glowy puffball things instead spent on them venting at each other would have already done so much like i want the end points of what theyre doing but the inbetween is missing\n\nseason  set up such an emotional story with the sisters but its buried in so many side plots now",

        "this show no matter how good to me will always feel that it needed just one more season a little more time to explore all the plots properly without having to make them happen offscreen and just let the public imagine what happened through small montages\n\nimagine season  being about cait doing her dictator shit and slowly realizing that she messed up and as vi said the hole in her heart get smaller and so does the pain and anger it also would explain how she and maddie got closer\n\nwhile on zaun we see more of jinx get some understanding of what she and vi had through vis perspective and what she made vi feel with her actions while bonding more with isha and sevika that just died when vander appeared it seems\n\nand we see more of viktor developing his community and getting more understanding of his power and not the rushed thing we got\n\nalso seeing vi actually dealing with the aftermatch of her fallout with cait instead of just jumping straight into another montage that summed months of pain and depression pretty well actually i have to give them that vis montage was amazing\n\nthen we could end the season with act  with warwick losing control jayces mistery and ishas sacrifice leaving another whole season to show how cait is going to deal with her fallout with ambessa how mels powers works what heimer and ekko have been dealing with how vi and jinx are going to deal with vandewick and how jinxs mind is going to be after what isha did they had to push foward just one more season for this to be absolute perfection for me but i guess it is what it is its still amazing and i still think this is the best animated series of the whole world but it is not going to be perfection i cant see they wraping things up in just three episodes unless they make a  hour special extra just to finish everything",

        "i love this show but am so getting a little frustrated at all the new charactersplot lines they keep introducing that dont seem to be going anywhere hopefully will be resolved in the final act but it seems like a lot to cram into  episodes maybe it makes more sense for people why pay lol and its targeted more to them\n\nmy main gripes are the ones that i worry wont be addressed\n\n what was salo doing in the hexgate when he saw jayce looked like he pulled some sort of reactor core out that freed jayce was he going you take that back to viktor for some purpose\n\n i understand that singed created vander werewolf as an experiment to bring back his daughter but what was his plan in getting captured and unleashing the werewolf on the enforcers",

        "viktor was literally just like we cant blame him and now everyones blaming him",
        "this is the problem when a generation grows up with all episodes releasing at once i see the same thing happen in live service games with a story they act as if something being unanswered in the middle of the story means theres a plothole the writers are lazy etc etc and then the next part drops answering all their questions and they move onto the next thing that isnt answered immediately",
        "some people have never read a good book with intrigue and it shows xd even in terms of good books what happened in e is not out of the blue in terms of shock or surprises either",
        "i mean everyone died with him that cant be good a person creating and being the leader of hivemind is scary",
        "literally hes so damn cool and he gets like  minutes of screen time every season",
        "people will be so mad but honestly i think its extremely believable for her to have a rebound situationship with someone and maddie was obviously a fan of hers",
        "aint no goddamn way",
        "i knew you guys would hate her as soon as this episode aired xd",
        "im in freaking denial",
        "dont forget jayce trying to prevent magic skynet of the future by killing metal boi viktor connor",
        "you really think caitlyn was hustling ambessa if so caitlyn is more cunning than we thought also in the preview for act  vi questions why caitlyn let ambessa deceive her so i am not sure that caitlyn was truly hustling her or just got caught up in the promise from ambessa to avenge her mothers death",
        "saving piltover and zaun from horrors beyond our comprehension",
        "jayce would not have killed his best friend for no reason he has seen or experienced something hellish he was seeing the cult members as these weird mechanical looking aliens",
        "yeah i feel like the only one that doesnt like his cult it seems so uncanny like yeah everyone looks happy at first glance but it also just doesnt seem right and obvious that this is an entirely new viktor not the same as he was before i am very eager to see what jayce has been through or found out there must be a reason jayce did that",
        "in my understanding it is been some weeks after the end of the first arc cait had enough time to digest what happened since the tea party her mother death and the effects of her actions in zaun at core cait wants to protect people of the city from violence and achieve peacewe know that from the greyson flashback but her alliance with ambessa and the hunt for jinx did the opposite her dialogue with maddie and ambessa shows that she wants an out of that situation and that she knows medarda is using her the prison massacre the alliance with the shimmerbeast creator and the readiness of her allies to attack an unarmed civilian camp to get vander makes her answer the question is love for family justification to commit violence even against innocents for ambessa and singed the answer is yes but seems caitlyn is leaning to a no answer in the end making cait being complicit in attacking an unarmed civilian camp with medarda and singed would be also out of her character too",
        "pasting my thoughts to someone elses comment on this \n\ni dont think its necessarily peachy keen between them yet but they clearly still had feelings for each other its obvious she is thinking about vi when she is with maddie it reads to me like a realistic way to treat someone you care deeply about after not seeing them for a long time despite being on different sides couple this with her very visibly becoming increasingly disgusted with ambessa and questioning her role as effective military dictator and it makes it reasonable that vi is the first step in her casting these toxic qualities away",
        "they are taking us towards viktors canon lore he is a transhumanist this is also implied by his dialogue",
        "thanks for pointing this out i had just hoped we would see a bit more of villain cait lol i dont think her relationship with vi will be fixed this easily but im glad they didnt dumb her down to be manipulated by ambessa til the end of the show that wouldnt be like her at all",
        "they have ambessa straight up says you dont trust me to caitlyn i dont know how can they make it more obvious",
        "like you wouldnt",
        "i didnt scream but i was taken aback",
        "cute cop girl which one was the second",
        "i knew she she took the gemstone but i didnt know she was gonna monkey bomb  the place",
        "my poor baby  and when she imitated jinx too",
        "i agree but it still sucks to see how victor and vander become their current league selves very tragic",
        "their fight felt kinda carthatic to me no gadgets weapons just punches and slaps something to let it out without hurting the other on the verge of killing just  sisters long overdue arguing after which they got kind of closer again and well the end of ep was all the best for it which i honestly didnt expect to see",
        "im assuming shes handling the business stuff of the revolution while jinx has fatherdaughter bonding time",
        "just saying every move is intentional in animation",
        "id rewatch the scene vander hits the fk out of jinx when she tries to get close to him \n\nisha sees her in pain and that vander might be too far gone might have been the best moment for her to step in while vander is distracted by zaun soldiers jinx has already lost the v to vander before",
        "shes just a little kid and probably doesnt have the best grasp on the situation however yeah it definitely seems like if isha doesnt do that vander basically selfdestructs and goes down fighting the noxians instead",
        "well technically itd be because a friend of mine likes the name violet vander is their adoptive dad i think",
        "im sad viktor died but honestly the spiritual possession of salo and the weird cult vibeslack of depth and emotions his followers gave off hinted that something is up",
        "i feel like if every episode was an hour long they could have pulled it off but condensing this much plot into nine forty minute episodes is insane theres no room for these scenes to breathe and no quiet moments with these characters",
        "i felt like the show needed to be three seasons before the first season  teaser even dropped i was surprised and immediately concerned when they said this would be the final season",
        "she looks so so so good",
        "young girl wants to be a hero like jinx but doesnt necessarily weigh the outcomes",
        "i think like powder in episode  she was a kid in a very emotional moment who probably thought it was necessary whos immediate thought was to save someone and wasnt weighing out all the proscons of her decision more than just feeling the need to do something",
        "she is struggling with the black rose because she is half their blood due to ambessa having a child with one of their own\n\nedit wording",
        "i dont think she flipped immideatly she was paranoid with ambessa an she wasnt on board with whole warwik thing as a weapon so i want surpised",
        "lots and lots of montages the pacing sometimes makes it seem like im watching a tiktok short",
        "some people theorize that isha is actually a weakened vessel of janna since her name means ruling goddess and her song invokes a lot of blue bird imagery so who knows maybe shell come back in the final act and give jinx closure\u00a0\n\n\nthis is me being delulu because what happened was just too sad",
        "i agree and pacing is the issue another season or couple of episodes to just let the story breathe a little bit would have been amazing",
        "yeah i agree with you i dont think she ever wanted to kill isha though she was only in the way never the target  she just genuinely believed she wouldnt miss her shot on jinx because she was blinded by hatred and revenge",
        "the only explanation that really fits is its basically an audition for ambessa on his own hes out of resources for experiments and research he hasnt attempted yet after warwick and needs more thats why he makes no effort to leave after the demonstration",
        "yup i was a bit surprised at how quickly they moved on from the pit fighting part i expected to at least see one interaction between vi and loris outside of the montage i also find it a bit weird that her alcoholism is not even shown after she leaves with jinx while she should show some withdrawal problems\n\ni hope loris and the fish guy will show ip and actually do something in act  not counting on it though",
        "isnt ekko more of benzos adoptee",
        "yeah the number of plots and their speed leaves some whiplash as on screen it feels like caits dark arc was  mins and shes already on the mend the show keeps surpassing itself visually but in retrospect it makes me appreciate even more how tight the script was for season  while juggling a big cast",
        "except he did didnt he i mean through his work within the beasts mind viktor was able to free vanders consciousness and subdue the beast the second viktor was gone vander completely lost control and the beast took over thats how i see it at least",
        "didnt even think of this but honestly a good guess as to whatll happen next",
        "viktor saw skye get vaporized before his very eyes hating the hex core for taking and not giving lines up with his dream \u00a0\n\nwhen he realizes skye lives on and they can follow this dream together well yeah thats a very different understanding of the hexcore",
        "i think viktor saw what his newly acquired powers were able to do and he slowly must have felt that he could cure people and hence started the commune remember viktor always wanted to use hextech to help people and now he could do that while fully being in control",
        "everyone who gets close to me dies",
        "one of the reasons it seems so weird for caitlyn to turn so quickly for vis sake is because she spent not one second even acknowledging vis existence in the entirety of act  up to that point no memory no dream no voice in her head no mention nothing \n\ncompare that to season  when vi and jinx were constantly thinking about each other so that by the time they finally reunited there had been so much buildup that the emotional payoff was huge there was no buildup to the reunion between vi and cait after some banter they seemed to pick up where they left off",
        "one of my favourite comment in this sub was saying the writers had to bench him and heimer in act  as otherwise they would have fixed the whole plot if they were around",
        "because there wasnt one it was what  scenes really cool scenes but all they added is something about a lost child of ambessa which honestly i didnt even understand the importance of i wish we saw more about that it is pretty interesting",
        "it didnt even just end abruptly  everything actually freezes still for a moment before it very very quickly fades to black \n\ni guess well find out if its ekko or if its just a weird editing choice next week",
        "maddie just wanted the pussy payroll",
        "yeah he had that air of importance about him but i guess if they dont do something in act  they somewhat wasted him",
        "honestly i kind of wanted her to be more misguided than she is could have been interesting to show how wellmeaning people get sucked into propping up bad systems but i think the show is probably not going to do the things i was hoping it would do thematically so now im just gonna enjoy or more likely cry over the ride",
        "she isnt she is going to be the link for after arcane \n\nthe next lol show is supposed to be about noxius so mel is the tie to it",
        "it definitely seemed to good to be true if all it took to unravel all the progress they made was the demise of viktor",
        "caitlyn never really trusted her at some point ambessa even straight up said to cait you dont trust me cait was just suckered into believing ambessa had the keys to getting peace back into her city even if she had to make some tough choices seeing the real extent of noxian cruelty ambessa flipping her opinion on singed and running into vi shocked her to her senses and made her realize she was super lost in her grief and trying to bring justice to jinx the last bit about grief is conjecture but thats what i get from the writing",
        "oil slicked vi called her cupcake lol",
        "we basically went nowhere for  episodes with her some mindfuckery and we are still in the same unsure place we left off in",
        "and the jesus got fucking shot\n\nby his terminator exbf who mysteriously lost a talking dog and his the coolest kid in the area in some industrial accident",
        "i dont remember that part of the bible",
        "funniest moment of the arc was jinx bitch slapping vi out of nowhere and vi just being too confused to be angry",
        "thank god the episode ended she would have died",

        "pew",
        "getting griffith flashbacks with that line",

        "oh no i absolutely love jayce as a character i just know the conversation around him is gonna be insufferable now cause of these episodes",
        "for real the episode  cliffhanger he did was the most interesting thing hes done in episodes we need scenes of what went down with him echo and heimerdinger asap they were cruel to show his actions before his motivations lol the internet is gonna kill em",
        "singed experimented on him this is new lore but its been built up to for a while now",
        "it was also hinted at in not only a brief shot while jinx shot the rocket in se but all of the ending scenes in act  were about the experiments getting the wolf parts to put into him like the eyes double heart etc as well as the shimmer and blood experiments",
        "i suppose singed explains it in the act  episodes but vander had the will to live like no one else and through trying to recover vander singed was able to advance his experiments in life preservation which he is doing to try and save his daughter",
        "crazy how this show ended up affecting lol so much they are renaming warwick to peacewick next patch also jinx will shoot flowers and vi will give hugs in their new kits picking viktor heals all players ingame from their tilt",
        "oh you just know we about to trip balls on some arcane eldritch horrors in the next act",
        "im really hoping that she is like secretly an ambessa spy or something so that i dont feel as bad when she is inevitably dumped by cait",
        "seeing the next arc teaser i wouldnt be surprised if singed does something with ww  viktor he did talk about wws incredible healing property after all",

        "true those people aint handling this like an adult haha",
        "thats funny given i interpreted it the exact opposite wayi viewed jayce as corrupted particularly due to some of the shots it showed of the rune in his wrist right before he went and did some crazy shit\n\ni viewed viktors monologue as essentially him deciding to sacrifice the people he cured in order to heal himself while simultaneously shedding some or all of his humanity due to him viewing his own survival as paramount to his vision that he views as ultimately good i also think his monologue touches on thisviktor is doing what he is doing for a good reason but it may ultimately come at a truly horrific price\n\nreally though i think either interpretation is valid and maybe thats part of the point of viktors monologue as well",
        "yeah lol and he kept saying things like i promise i will fix it he might be talking to ekko and heimer who built some sort of time machine to send him back or maybe he even experienced multiple timeline es explains why he looked so so bad like that",
        "id be surprised if it wasnt the void at this point if thats jayce now i wonder what ekko and heimerdinger are like if they also saw the same things",
        "i mean he is hot so i will forgive him i guess",
        "its likely linked to the void as we know it from the league of legends universe",
        "these hoes aint loyal",
        "might is an important word the cult might have a problem but from what weve seen the only issue they have is the army wanting to kill them for daring to help heal their war machine and some guy killing their leader jayce may have a good reason for what he did but we just saw him get absorbed by a magical reactor and come out clearly a few sandwiches short of a picnic",
        "the tree being corrupted by the aberration of natural ought to have clued people in",

        "after the lengths he went to to save viktors life and then without a second thought chooses to kill him to stop whatever is happening tells me theres some fucked up lovecraftian shit going on in the arcane",

        "what if jayces rune is all about visions of tomorrow  what if jayce is able to see whats coming  would it not be logic that such knowledge would be hard to handle and understand  jayce is the defender of tomorrow and it could be a way for him to earn that title  for real  the last sentence of the sneak peak  yeah im sorry but i think viktor is corrupted to the bones by the wild rune  again  this thing that needs to take sky appearance in order to get viktor trust it just doesnt feel right",

        "i have to talk about ekko and heimerdinger and the absolutely incredible writing behind their characters time legacy and perspective \n\nheimerdinger comes into the series as an incredibly intelligent wise man of the world his view of the world crafted by the concept of living for hundreds of years he glorifies the city he built and the vision that it holds the concept of progress and has so much pride in the city he built because of all it has accomplished these grand things are so far beyond watching the interactions of the people within it so blinded by his own success and legacy that he misses the suffering that happens to prop it up when he witnesses the arcane all he sees is the possible destruction of his society and does not realise how much this power means to those who need it a city of gold metal and marble standing over those wallowing in the dirt he holds some of the most blame if not the entire blame for how the city has turned out \n\nekko however is his counterpart an inventor just like heimerdinger but here he is restricted by age and environment his technology is all made to explore and enhance the moments each person has and to find importance in these things ekko also builds his community around the natural world not something to control but to nurture he doesnt focus on the legacy of his creation but how his creation helps facilitate life the invention isnt the important part life and the human experience is at the center of all ekko strives for \n\nheimerdinger only starts to see his failings when he is cast out from his own creation forced to interact with the parts that he never even considered important and why would they be important the city he built was his ideology and legacy crafted into a magnificent monument on the world stage the outcome was clear that he was acting correctly and that only convinced himself even more of his own moral integrity and vision in the undercity he sees that his vision of progress is one that pushes the less fortunate further into the dirt why does this happen because heimerdinger sees the value in monumental achievements moments in history that stand out against others for how remarkable they are by celebrating this he ignores the everyday moments and sees them as worth so much less all culminating when he finds ekko and his hoverboard and immediately assumes he knows that the blade pitching is incorrect because he has no perspective outside of his own when comparing the life of someone who has hundreds of years to someone who only has twenty how could they possibly know more than he does\n\nekko in sharp contrast creates a monument to everyone who lost their life no matter if they were a fancy inventor or just an outcast everyone to him and every moment they have is important he strives to make all of these moments better to give them opportunities to live their lives in the best way they can none of them more important than any other his society is not about finding the best amongst them and holding them up high as a statue to progress the opposite of what piltover stands for and why it is so easy for those on top side to see the other as lesser in a society where they revere some as naturally more gifted because of the inventions that society and those in power see as useful ekko stands as a force against that mentality \n\nin season  we start to see heimerdinger really start to wake up to his errors even very directly speaking into the camera id always presumed it was due to mankinds turbulent relationship with power but perhaps it is a property of the arcane itself or to paraphrase it is the system not the people that use it that are the problem a wonderful parallel to the actual society of piltover and the ideology that fuels it and the discrimination and prejudice that it causes heimerdingers ideology every action sparks a reaction for every scientist they raise up they lower someone down and make them worth less \n\nin episode seven he is repeating his mistakes looking at society and his accomplishments to make it what it is rather than focusing on the individuals and their lives and struggles ive been able to accomplish wonderful things in this world give it time to settle his focus on time bearing out in the end shows an apathy for what is happening right now it is no wonder that ekkos invention focuses on rewriting a few precious seconds whilst heimerdinger ponders about the destination to come years later \n\nekko learns the opposite lesson in this episode to heimerdinger about holding onto the monuments of the past the understanding that progress true progress comes at the cost of what was there before something that until this point heimerdinger was never able to face his desperation to hold onto what he beleived to be true never accept that he was wrong and to brush off the needs of others to preserve that image of his dream his legacy and the way he saw the world is what caused so much pain and suffering in the city even with good intentions the incapacity to change was his downfall sometimes taking a leap forward means leaving a few things behind \n\nfinally at the end of it all heimerdinger makes the ultimate sacrifice leaves behind his chance to see the fruits of his labour to witness his legacy and enjoy the final moments he has in order to send ekko back not with an invention that can be used over and over again and to live on but one that can only be used once with no ability to retrieve it never a dull moment finally realising that every moment is important not just the ones that supported his dream finally fulfilling that arc set up in season  he realised that nothing he could accomplish could compare to the contributions of his students and he learned it by seeing a piltover that could have been if his ideology striving for the moments that make progress happen wasnt the driving force behind the city \n\nbravo fucking bravo arcane \n\nif anyone made it this far just leave a small one word comment i love this show and i have so much to say id love to know what people think of my analysis or that someone even read it haha",
        "it was so funny how arcane social media released a sevika poster last week and she had no lines for the entire act  \n\ni guess her poster was just showing her getting possessed",
        "man i am so conflicted i never thought id say this but i actually really wanted a happy ending for this show because these characters have gone through so much trauma i just want to see vi and cait ekko and jinx all together an be happy to send the message that even through all this shit there is still hope and people can change\n\ninstead we get a show that is filled with trauma that ends with even more trauma and bittersweetness i mean even in my hypothetical happy ending these characters would still have to deal with and accept the loss of vander of caits mother and everyone else who died in that final battle\n\ni also dont like how the very interesting sisterplot between vi and jinx kinda got sidelined in favor of this worldending threat story with victor its a good story for sure but i really feel like we didnt get the closure or development we needed with the girls \n\nthat jinx death also didnt hit as hard for me because of the fact that we have so many of these traumatic moments so far it would actually have been a relief to see a happy ending now that would have brought a tear to my eye like blisters and bedrock did \n\nnow we have a depressed ekko that thinks jinx is dead and we have jinx possibly being alive but she still thinks the only way she can live is if she abandons those she loves because she still thinks she ruins everything refering to the theory that she left on that zeppelin in the end\n\n  \ntldr\n\ngod damn it i really hoped we would see jinx truly come to terms with what she had done and found peace with herself so she could exist with vi i just wanted these beautiful characters to be happy instead of having to deal with even more loss",

        "i dont think my mind knows how to process this finale i have no issue with where the plot threads ended up and where we got to in the end but it was just a matter of how fast we got there episode  was the last episode where i had the time to process everything happening as i watched and i do really like episode  but after that it just felt like we were moving from one scene to the next especially when each scene has big impacts on the characters\n\nto me arcane really excelled when it kept things small and moving to big war scenes at the end felt like a shift in style that was maybe slightly uncharacteristic for the series some subplots were slightly less developed too  if anyone could explain what was going on in the black rose subplot and with what mel did in the end\n\ni guess i might need a rewatch because it all passed a little too quick for a series that is possibly one of my favorite series ever",
        "sesbian lex",
        "i want episode  tattooed into my brain this is where i choose to believe the story ended with the sweetest most heartwarming moment jinx and ekko sharing a dance and a kiss\n\ncan we just pretend like its the first time",
        "why does power with the extra gemstones reveal feel like some marvel end credit type tease lmfao\n\ni feel like they could unironically build upon that",
        "now that the show is over  shoutout to the community yall have made discussing this show so entertaining between the discussion theories and memes",
        "it shocked me to realize that sevika had no lines and just  minute screentime entirety of act",
        "what the actual fuck dont get me wrong it was a great season and a great series overall but you dont get to end there you just dont like im pretty sure there are laws against this sort of ending",
        "what even was ambessas plan im so confused about so many story points",
        "i feel like theres a directors cut out there that we all desperately want to see",
        "the biggest disappointment in the arcane ending for me is that we never got to see a scene where ekko returns to the tree witnessing it being cured of hextech seeing the people of zaun living better lives than ever before in this universe and realising zaun is moving toward the hopeful vision ekko glimpsed in the alternate timeline ekko deserved that payoff moment so much he gave up the paradise he dreamed of to save his people\n\nwhile we can assume this will happen offscreen based on the ending not showing us this brief meaningful sequence feels almost disrespectful\n\ndont get me wrong i really enjoyed the final scene of ekko sitting alone and commemorating powder it was truly heartbreaking and evoked strong emotions however ekkos main goal in our universe was to save his people and make zaun a better place showing the results of his efforts toward this goal would have been a perfect way to wrap up his storyline",
        "so far this feels pretty rushed with a lot of characters just appearing and disappearing into and out of nowhere between wildly different settings and scenarios with little explanation as to how they got there or what theyre even doing\n\nthe piltovernoxisviktoreverybody conflict is something that shouldve been the basis of an entire season  not a single episode",
        "glad they put my girl on the council",
        "the beginning of episode  couldve been so good jynx is finally ready to die she burns all her possessions and pulls the pin on her classic grenade the thing that started it all then ekko who in season  said there cant be any good left in jynx but saw the insane potential she holds throughout episode  saves her multiple times even at the detriment of himself this is the one truly good character about to convince the suicidal misfit that there is a reason to keep going then it cuts to black they skip over that entire fucking discussion scene insane",
        "honestly i really think the writers bit off more than they could chew with this entire seasons main plot the story was so insanely tight and well paced in season  where it was the more simple piltover vs zaun vi x jynx plots and there was easily another seasons worth of content you couldve got from those arcs but instead it just got grander and grander and basically ended up being humanity vs god and that is just insanely hard to pull off with the same tight storytelling",
        "what the fuck ive never loved and hated aspects of a series finale more than this\u00a0\n\n\njayce and viktors resolution perfect jinxs ending awful ekkos final stand perfect ambessas ending meh maddies betrayal perfect maddies ending hilariousand its basically like that for the whole act im so damn conflicted i want to call it amazing and awfully disappointing so its probably both to me lol",
        "what the fuck",
        "this show really suffered from cramming two seasons worth of content into one im so mixed on s its probably like an  but following up a  and one of the best seasons of television ive ever seen makes it so much more disappointing like i almost wish it didnt get a s\n\ni think i need time and to watch the entire series again to sort out my feelings maybe in a few months",
        "this season honestly makes me feel kinda weird dont get me wrong i absolutely loved it and was blown away but it really feels like the story was massively rewritten after season  because the tone and scope are just so drastically different and the plot lines went into directions that they clearly werent originally meant to go its like if arcane got cancelled after season  and what we saw was someones fanfiction or like all of the writers got replaced \n\nbecause you cant seriously tell me that old man viktor was always supposed to be that mage from season  or that vander and silco were always supposed to have known vi powder and their parents or that the whole multiversaltimetravelingworldending crisis was always supposed to be the endgame or if it was then there shouldve been one more season to bridge this gap between a characterfocused story about social inequality and the cyberzombie apocalypse plot",
        "we needed  seasons",
        "now i understood why people ship jayce and viktor well the last scenes were pretty gay\n\nedited people this is my personal feeling from act  if you have another way viewing them i dont mind in addition to people said that soulmates is better answer gay people can still be soulmates gay doesnt mean people have zero understanding and emotional connection \n\ndespite this i dont view jayce as gay the characters can be straight or bisexual i dont care about labels people can still have unexpected experience in their life",
        "vi having sex when her sister is clearly unstable and a threat to herself is legitimately insane",
        "i watched the sesbian lex scene with my parents",
        "it was so fucking meta and poetic that everything went shit after ambessa and viktor started to follow singed plans\n\nlol rule  guys\n\nnever follow the singed \n\nnever follow the singed\n\nnever follow the singed",
        "so whether jinx is really dead or not i find the choice deeply annoying if i had a dime for every time character death was used to sidestep the question of how to really make up for past wrongs i could probably pay off my college debt by having everyone think shes dead it becomes a null question whether any of the remaining characters can forgive her or not wrapping it up without really resolving it its quick and easy but its not very deep and i thought if there was one show that might do something more interesting and mature it would be arcane but no",
        "its funny that ekko essentially caused this whole mess in s e by giving vi the lead to jayces apartment and then ultimately being the one that saves every single person of piltover and zaun and succeeded on the brink of disaster in s e full circle baby",
        "i cant believe vi saying the undercity is gonna eat you alive was foreshadowing for the sex scene this whole time",
        "i want to write about my thoughts in more depth in a later review but i just want to say what a weak third act mixed pacing dialogue that borders on being unimaginative to not making sense and a ninth episode that just feels incredibly unpolished\n\nto go from a focused story about a small cast of characters and their stories to bring the scale up to a full on war is such a dull decision in my opinion where arcane shines the most is not the story but rather the characters driving the story the focused climax of season one with jinx caitlyn vi and silco and only having to share that story arc with the council figuring out if they wanted to achieve peace with zaun felt like a perfect balance bit having to fulfill all your storylines about namely mel vi cait jayse viktor ekko and jinx is frankly too much for a single episode finale to handle to be honest i hate how in the first place the show has to resort to a war to bring piltover together\n\noh yeah guys we need the end of our show to bring topside and zaun together because we want a happy ending how do we go about doing this\n\nyeah lets have ambessa do a funny and start a war\n\nwhat about how cait and vis relationship in season one teased how topside could get along with piltover heck silco wanted a nation of zaun and from what we could tell it couldve been accomplished\n\nnah\n\nand then its implied that zaun gets one seat at the council with sevika lmaooooooo\n\ni really liked arc one arc two got a bit messy but i still enjoyed it and arc three is just a mess if im ever rewatching arcane im sticking with season one it frustrates me because i dont want to have negative thoughts about a show i consider one of my favorites of all time but this final arc frustrates me because a character driven and focused show got its scale dragged to a war because it couldnt find a way to handle how ever many plotlines it wanted to start",
        "i feel like they couldve told the story way better and less rushed with an extra season",
        "i may be in the minority on this but as someone who felt like vander got a raw deal in arcane i feel like the two main perpetrators silco and sevika had very poetic endings in that they became the very things they criticized vander for \n\nsilco died finally understanding why vander would choose safety for his kids over zaun\n\nsevika ended up on the council after several failed attempts at sparking a revolutiona collaborator\n\ni also love the shots of both of them with vanders statue as they each presumably on sevikas part come to the conclusion that maybe vander wasnt entirely wrong",
        "at least maddie bit the curb though amen  but still what the actual fuck just happened that is not the end i am left with more questions than answers",
        "the only winner was singed he literally got his daughter back without sacrificing anything of value for him he messed up everything but he got his final goal the true mastermind tbh",
        "honestly i was really bracing myself to cry and be sad that arcane was ending\n\nbut that really didnt feel all that satisfying i was more like thats it\n\ni dont know because i dont think it was bad by any stretch but it definitely didnt feel like the finale",
        "anyone else feel like the caitvi scene was out of place like i wanted it but it just didnt fit",
        "the jayce viktor sequence has to be one of the most beautiful things ive seen in my entire life gave me madoka vibes\n\nthat aside i loved this finale but im a masochist and like being emotionally destroyed so maybe im in the minority\n\nit was definitely rushed the whole season was but im okay with that ultimately i still feel like i witnessed something special and the story they wanted to tell was told\n\nand i dont think jinx is dead possibly total copium but idc its ambiguous for a reason",
        "i might get attacked for this but that sex scene with cait and vi was kinda fucked given the situation your sister was in the darkest hole shes ever been in grieving the one friend shes had in forever clearly on the cusp of suicide and the moment you see cait youre like lets have sex right now in this dirty ass cell nah that was not it",
        "ok but can we talk about how its crazy that vi dying is what would give them a peaceful life",
        "episode s what could have been may make it a contender for meanest episode of any show ever",
        "rewatching episode  its kinda funny the writers try so hard to distract you by cutting scenes from battlefield to battlefield but viktor was really just unbeatable like he won it was over but apparently ekko didnt get assimilated because he was knocked out or something then he did weird time shit to basically throw yet another hex core to the already unbeatable god and the good guys only win because viktor goes eh maybe youre right jayce itd be boring if i went through with this then they kill themselves",
        "is it just me or each act of this season feel like they are from different shows\n\nwhile season  feels like an organic and cohesive story from beginning to end\n\nseason  feels weird dont get wrong im pretty much entertained the whole way through but this season kind of feels like a fever dream",
        "it feels like despite their claims of being over theres still a lot of wrapping up necessary for this show viktor and jayce have disappeared warwick kinda never got a real chance to shine jinx missing heimerdinger is maybe dead but why kill him when he hasnt really completed his arc\n\ni feel like theres more on the cooker than what we saw but how",
        "they pulled an end game beautiful animation sound desing shame the story writing wasnt on par\n\nin the words of viktor in the pursuit of great they failed to do good\n\nstill a pretty good show",
        "can we all just agree singed woneverything",
        "okay i think i have my thoughts on how this ended\n\ni think writing wise and thematically act  was really well done could it have been better if they stretched it out a bit more yes but the quality of the writing this act was top notch\n\nas for the actual ending itself im left disappointed i think and there are a few reasons why\n\nthe smaller reason is jayce and viktor i think they actually wrap that up pretty nicely but there isnt really enough time after that for anyone to acknowledge or reflect on what jayce has done it is such a major moment and it feels like it winds up being a footnote\n\nthe larger reason is vijinx who in my opinion are the main characters\n\nthe first part is just the insane amount of misery in this show i like a bittersweet ending i like that not everyone rides off into the sunset but with this show i think it was out of proportion the amount of misery leading up to the end of this act deserved a bit more payoff to make it worth it and i think in the end we still have a ton of likable characters with subpar or upsetting endings\n\nand it is amplified by just how much they teased a good ending act  with vander episode  with the what couldve been timeline there was room to give us some of that and we got none of it\n\nthe second part comes back to vi and jinx and just how depressing their story is jinx gets a taste of family again with isha and vander but loses it all what is vis happy ending cait she still just lost her sister and clearly from her reaction after she comes back from viktors control she still has hope for vander family is so important to vi and it feels like it is consistently taken from her dangling a carrot in front of a horse\n\nvi gets absolutely shafted she cant save vander again and then cant save jinx i dont understand i wouldnt have minded them teasing vander if he was the catalyst that repaired the relationship with vijinx but the repaired relationship was so short lived it is difficult to really feel the impact of it similar to how quickly they move on from jayces ending\n\nand yes jinx may be alive still i know but if she is we still dont get to see any of the payoff of them fixing their relationship sure it may come up in a spinoff but i highly doubt they revisit these characters and while open endings are fine i dont think this show could afford them given just how negative the experience of so many characters was it leaves you feeling completely unsatisfied you get so invested in these characters and nearly no payoff to justify it\n\nit isnt that it was bad writing it is just so depressing and so unsatisfactory episode quality  amazing standalone value was really high in my opinion i dont blame anyone for liking it but i cant wrap my head around it at this point and it really just leaves a sour taste in my mouth considering how wonderful this show was i just wanted to like the ending after so much misery and given the lack of clarity with the ending i just cant ill have to sit on it more but i wanted to leave this show with a different feeling",
        "really disappointed in how the whole piltover vs zaun class conflict ended because the people of zaun decided to listen to jayce basically say look i know weve never seen eye to eye weve continually oppressed you and widely think of you all as animals but theres an unbeatable god coming with a robot army and bad things will probably happen if he wins come on up and defend my town please and some of them actually decided to specifically the jinxers literally what reason do they have to want to stay and fight considering they see their idol as a beacon of hope against piltover another really weird plot point that shouldve been explored how exactly is jinx seen as a hero for bombing an ongoing peace treaty \n\nand then viktor and his robots show up and it isnt even a fight at that point he dominates everyone and just wins then ekko does his time shit and jayce does his hey vik maybe dont thing and suddenly zaun has a seat at the council lead by sevika who had zero spoken lines in act  \n\njust such a lazy way to resolve the conflict that lasted like a season and a half just because weve got bigger problems now lets go fight god",
        "on rewatch i didnt feel acts  or  were rushed like others claims i didnt feel like episode  or  were rushed either besides everything jinx but  that shit felt like they wanted a  hour movie but forgot they only had  minutes \n\nstill adore the fuck out of the show",
        "episode  was probably one of the best episodes in whole arcane  both s and s they managed to depict a timebomb romance  something i never cared at all in a way that felt incredibly heartfelt romantic and genuine im a caitvi shipper but i think tb got the best romantic sequence in the show even when caitvi and jaymel got to have sex \n\nep  and  probably will require several rewatches but i didnt feel anything when watching them whole prison sex felt like a checklist needed to be fulfilled when cait and vi had hardly any conversation since ep and no true reconcillation or understanding \n\nway too fast way too much in too little episodes plot went too wide instead of focusing on characters it focused on plot which made it worse",
        "so in the melcaitlyn vs ambessa fight mel eventually gets the upper hand by caitlyn sacrificing her eye to cut off the runes then she says no mercy and sends ambessa to the black rose presumably to die she then follows after and tells br youre a deceiver and saves ambessa from them and then ambessa dies right after that anyways no idea what that was all about",
        "im still kinda pissed right now so i might be ranting here but the problem with this finale and kind of season  as a whole is that it stopped being a character driven story and became a plot driven story i loved season  so much because of all the relationships between the characters and the actions and consequences due to choices made \nby those characters \n\nin season  the plot was dragging everyone along to hit major story beats some of which i didnt really care about i also dont play league or know the lore either to me the best moments this season were the sisters reuniting with vander ekko and jinx in the alternate universe and jayce and viktor send off i was actually crying here their friendship was so sweet \n\nso when the main focus of this act is about war it loses focus on the individual characters and their relationships killing off jinx in the last  min felt so fucking unearned i told myself that if she died i would be devastated but only because i thought theyd give her a proper send off now im just pissed because it came out of nowhere i get that she might not be dead but her conclusion to this entire story feels very underwhelming to me id rather cope and believe that her story concluded in ep \n\nedit another thing i wanted to add i feel like most people agree that vi and jinx are the main characters of this story and yet there was no conclusion here between them",
        "season  ended with a very character focused ultimatelly sorta lowstakes scene vi and jinx at the tea party proving to themselves once and for all that theyre too different too appart to ever be together again like they used to amazing dialogue incredible emotional payoff and a moment that has stuck with me for literal years \n\nseason  ended with a huge war full of magic lasers and dragged out fight scenes where half the cast died and all i could emotionally muster up was a ah i guess thats it then ill already have forgotten half of what happens a month from now",
        "have to admit i find jayces speech about imperfections somewhat flawed yeah its a nice thing to say that he loves viktor flaws and all but it kinda seemed like he was disparaging viktors condition\n\nlike my dude wanting to cure your bum leg and disease is something everyone wants thats not an imperfection people wanna keep",

        "so whats up with the end a  eyed raven finds the gemstone jayce had what is cait talking about with a war and still being in the fight is noxus coming to fight im assuming its vi and cait on the airship at the end edit i misread the scene with cait looking at the the map and the airship seems plausible that jinx is alive which i like are jayce heimer and vic dead or in a different world again rip to vander for the rd time\n\ni enjoyed the hell out of this show but i wish things could have gone a bit differently or i wish we had gotten either a rd season or longer episodes because things were really going at a break neck speed here there wasnt much time to breathe season  had more emotional weight to it the ending of season  was predictable unfortunately and i think for me at least took away from the emotion of it all",
        "i spent maybe the last  or  minutes of episode  bawling i keep begging for things to be different i dont even know how to process everything it felt unsatisfying i dont know if it was because that chan leak turned out to be word for word true or because my unhealthy obsession with jinx jayce and viktor lead me down the path of hating any conclusion resulting in their death maybe its selfish to say i wanted them to live where jinx could try to make amends for what she did exiled or something jayce continuing to be the man of tomorrow viktor in some way being the machine herald we all love i dont know if my distaste and dissatisfaction come from emotion or actually believing it was poorly written but irregardless im devastated and im at a loss for words on how they chose to end jinxs story",
        "once they announced this was going to be the final season i knew there was no way they could end it without it being polarizing in some way \n\nafter digesting on it a bit i personally like this ending but i think people are totally justified in not",
        "what the fuck",
        "for me ultimately  the problem when comparing s to s is the same problem i find a lot of movies  tv shows suffer with nowadays\n\nthey start with a very grounded story and the world feels way more relatable  the characters get lots of time to grow all the little details  events etc\n\nthen what happens with shows like this is we basically start picking up speed to conclude a everybody saves the world generic action packed conclusion where everything takes a permanent back seat to whatever huge action set pieces need to happen\n\ni know that nobody is ever  happy  you cant all get your ideal endings but man i much preferred s in almost every way i just wish that more showsmovies would just carry on at a similar pace from the first part until the last\n\ni think especially with superhero movies having dominated pop culture for over a decade im just really tired of seeing all of the interesting slow build characters  plot lines devolve into some epic battle for the world or whatever\n\n i know its literally called arcane but i cant help but imagine how a story focusing on zaun vs piltover  the struggle between the  sisters couldve gone with the same level of pacing in s minus most of the hextech plot or even the noxus involvement \n\nim begging these writers to give us some stories that dont culminate in a marvel esque team up to save everybody",
        "so jinx tells vi she is doomed and everyone will die because of her and she will end it vi goes and initiates sex in her sisters cell while her sister goes to off herself then jinx sacrifices herself even if she did not die for her and barley any aftermath from vi i am sorry but how can a professional writer write this jinx and vi were the heart of this story this disconnect is unjustifiable",
        "bittersweet ending im glad its implied that jinx is alive but i feel so bad for ekko he was there alone after all he did to save everyone i need an epilogue i need to know how hes doing after that",
        "clearly the main viktor whatever you call the hooded figured knew jayce was gonna mess it up because he laid out the foreshadowing of the rooftop fight but i think its hilarious he explains to jayce hes the only one who can show himself the truth jayce is like alright send me back i got this and then he blasts him instead of showing him through the rune like he does in the end \n\nalso if were assuming jinx made it out and cait knowssuspects it how do you think vi feels ifwhen she finds out thats gonna sting",
        "the whole black rose plot was worse than i expected it was loosely connected to the plot and the conclusion made no sense legit felt like wasted screen time at best its a lame marvelesque tease at some new show or spinoff at worst its an attempt to set up something for the game like a new character or something\n\ni guess people who play league of legends might understand it better but it was confusing and pointless to me and everyone i was watching with some of whom have not played the game in  years the worst things an arc could be in a show with already too many plotlines for its own good",
        "act  needed to be a season on its own the writers might have decided ahead to have only two seasons but if you realize that you are including too many storylines and your story needs it at least consider it\n\napart from this it was emotional and i am still crying i hope to see jinx in other shows with something that could give her a proper conclusion because i believe they did not truly fulfill it and it must have been intentional",
        "whatever happened to ambessas twink from season  i hope hes ok",
        "im going to say this  they shouldve never introduced warwick\n\nget rid of him from the show and you maintain the tension between jinx and vi it doesnt randomly vanish over half an episode i felt it was a really cheap way to reunite the sisters and undermined jinxs return to sanity because of isha\n\ni dunno soon as he appeared i just knew the season was going in a weird direction loved rhe show dont get me wrong but really they shouldve had less happen in the season kept the story simpler like the first season to give everything enough time to actually breathe and develop",
        "is heimer sacrificing himself nooooooo",
        "man i wish i disagreed with all the comments on here i didnt like the pacing or writing much this season but i was really really hopeful that they would pull it together for the last few episodes i really liked episode  but the rest was just a jumbled mess to me i never ever want to say something bad about a series that means this much for me but this act felt completely unrecognizable\n\nhonestly it makes me really sad that a show that i fell in love with for its intimate character moments ended as an hourlong fight scene against a bunch of faceless zombies it felt very superheromovieesque which are fun in their own right but not the look i wanted to see on arcane and jinxs death used one of the most overdone death tropes i have ever seen not to mention the crazy mixedmessaging it sends about suicide this whole season we see jinx getting better seeing the good in the world and when she wants to kill herself shes talked out of it for the sake of her loved ones so in the end the right narrative decision is for her tocommit suicide why\n\nalso i feel like no one is mentioning how cheesy the dialogue felt in these last episodes it hasnt been great all season but lines like oinking in your ear and especially the whole im with you sister thing made me actively cringe the dialogue was so fantastic last season i just cant even wrap my head around this \n\narcane has been one of my favorite shows since it first came out and i still think that s is some of the best art that human beings can possibly produce and obviously s wasnt lacking in artistry either i just wish it landed better in the end though we got our caitvi scene and thats all that really matters",
        "love mel but the black rose made the series messy that time could have been spent building up the fall and rise of caitlyn jinx becoming more mentally stable viktor becoming more of a villain on top of not making sense and forcing mel into a role that doesnt necessarily fit her the black rose probably ruined the season",
        "sadly the bigger the stakes are the more boring the story is\n\ngive me grounded family drama over the world is going to end nonsense any day of the week",

        "episode  was incredible it gave me the same satisfaction i felt while watching season  despite the obvious pacing issues especially in episode  at least the phenomenal  music and animation stayed consistent throughout the whole series  sucks that they fumbled the finale a bit i wish episodes  were longer an additional episode was added or a final act  was in play there wouldve been more room to flesh out the writings pacing and explain some unsolved mysteries that shouldve been answered i get that not everything needs to be highlighted but it felt like too many things were left unanswered season  wouldve been  still enjoyed the whole series overall regardless of the finale tho",
        "either the  yearsold planned ending should have evolved with the story or the sisters story should have been crafted to fit the ending better but no the ending of season  felt like fitting a square peg act  into a round hole season  and season  acts  aka it felt differentdisjointed\n\nendings are difficult to write and im not a writer so i am grateful they tried their best i definitely do not hate on the series or the creators or the company  there is very much i like about arcane \n\nhowever the ending to me was massively disappointing  regarding vi and jinx mostly especially after amanda said in bridging the rift that she helped change the pilot because of the sisters",
        "ekko is indeed the boy savior",
        "will love the show especially the first season forever ordered even the steelbook for it but the pacing of season  left so much to be desired i didnt understand half of the stuff that was happening because its supposed to lead into another series which i dont like because a show should be able to stand on its own two feeds or because its some lol lore of the game which i shouldnt need to have played to understand the series also the relationship between jinx and vi the centerpiece of season one didnt receive enough attention at all just like the conversation between jinx and cait the revolution of zaun and its war with piltover topic of one episode and then shoved back until they suddenly have a seat on the council i know its because of their contributions to the battle but this is just far far too quick the end even if jinx survived left me so empty they didnt have any conversation at all like what thats it \n\nthis show began with a separation of two sisters and their struggle to find one another again and at the end turned into a semi scifi battle they needed a season  even the animation which was insane and even a step up from the previous season couldnt save that people always claim that animation uses every second and that arcane mastered that brilliantly and i agree but they exaggerated it this time so that i wasnt even sad when it ended because someone died or maybe did not i was just wondering what happened \n\nwhere are my characterdriven story lines where are my deep conversations where is the show that centers around our two sisters\n\ni am probably a bit too irrational because i just finished the finale and perhaps once i wake up tomorrow i see things a bit more mildly but now i am just disappointed and even a bit angry",
        "we shared a vision studio fortiche a dream of freedom not just for the lanes but for the whole of the underground united as one the nation of zaun do you even remember",
        "mixed feelings about the ending  my main gripe is how viktor was handled this season he didnt really get much screentime until episode  so it was hard to believe his jump to joining ambessa in act i hate to say this but i blame the inclusion of sky for detracting a lot from viktors character\n\nfirst she only appears in one scene before the one where she get disintegrated so i literally did not care about her death at all i thought her first scene was meant to emphasize the dichotomy between jayce and viktors lives after the invention of hextech but afterwards she became more of a plot device which felt very random to me\n\nsecond after her death viktor becomes antihextech only for him to embrace hextech again fully a few episodes later this change in how he perceives hextech feel extremely clunky if viktor had continued augmenting his body the sky incident it would have made a lot of sense why he would follow hextech so closely and try to spread it to other people  its a very natural progression but theres a very awkward time period where hes antihextech which makes his motivations very confusing in season \n\nthird i feel viktor having visions of sky detracts a lot from viktors agency throughout season  one thing i love most about arcane is how much agency each character has in making their own decisions based on what they believe is best even if the outcome is bad it makes these characters likeable because its as if they are fully serving themselves but the visions of sky that viktor sees through the hex core seems to control or influence viktor in a way or at least it gives off that impression so its hard for me to believe that everything viktor did in season  was really because he wanted to do those things or if he was under the hex cores control if its the latter than its as if viktor isnt a character this season but rather a corpse being controlled by an evil entity which i dont find very interesting it would have been better imo if he was embracing the hex core completely under his own motivations\n\nof course i had other gripes about season  but overall there were a lot of things i really enjoyed but in my opinion i feel like adding sky did more harm than good to viktor as a character throughout these two seasons would love to hear others thoughts",
        "the postshow depression is real like damn its really over",
        "holy shit i feel so empty after watching act  sad about arcane being over and hope that we still get to see caitvi and all the other characters in later shows i felt like cait and vi had less scenes in the last act wish they had more",

        "wow just wow despite the valid feedback on pacing i actually loved how act  turned out\n\nfirst things first episode  is a masterpiece coming in i was expecting the climax of the story but the extreme contrast of a peaceful alternate timeline had me bewildered in a damn good way if i may add it was far better than a climax it had everything we wanted presented in a fleeting episode hors doeuvre in a place where an entree is expected it is the literary version of trompe loeil\n\nalso the art and dialogue in act  feels like a step above it had lots of scenes that looked really artistic i lost track of the times i had to pause to digest a frame or scene\n\nspeaking of alternate timelines i loved how smoothly they introduced the concept of multiverses i understand it can be kind of a cop out in storytelling but in hindsight it feels like it belongs to arcane because of the game each play through can be considered a multiverse in essence\n\nlast and not the least the ending gave the perception that no character is inherently good or evilexcept maddie they just had different goals some have simple goals while others have a vision that is too complex to relate to and despite the pacing i think the writers did a great job in communicating their stories its not the traditional happy ending but almost all of the characters got a piece of the ending that they pursued we should all really be content but for a once in a generation masterpiece like arcane it will never be enough",
        "ii just feel bad for ekko my man \n\nlet him have some happiness in life dude\n\ni feel like act  is way too rush imo i was like how tf they gonna explain all subplots going on in three episodes and they justdont",
        "i felt the ending didnt really show what happened to everyone after the big war for example we dont really know what ekko is going to do now what happens to piltover and zaun caitlyn and vi also i was a bit dissapointed to see jinxs death not really acknowledged by vi after the scene she just ends with caitlyn like damn\n\nalso wtf happend to jayce and viktor are they dead",
        "ok guys next analysis post\n\ncait and silco two sides of the same coin privilege and oppression\n\nive not seen anyone really compare these two characters that have such incredible parallels i only noticed it in e when i saw the pattern connect\n\nsilco is a seperatist fighting for freedom in an oppressed society so that the people he fights for will finally be free of their oppressors a man born in the gutters and coming from nothing experiencing the worst of the world cait is the child of a noble family one of the most powerful families in piltover and fights for herself to prove her worth and explore the world that shes seen nothing of only experiencing the softest parts of society and craving more\n\nthese two characters cannot possibly be more different in background and starting setting silco fights for his seat at the table whilst cait inherits it both intelligent resourceful tactical and prefer outmaneuvering to brute force they both end up the defacto leaders of their armies in a fight against an opponent blinded by rage and willing to sacrifice their humanity to succeed in their goals it is no coincidence that both silco and cait use the toxic gas of the underground to fight against their enemies and control them compare the scene in s e with silco and the chembarons with cait in s e turning off their air and releasing toxic gas to get what they want silco is trying to keep order and prevent a worse outcome keeping zaun united at any cost caitlyn is doing it to avoid a full out invasion of zaun both have noble goals but are willing to induce chemical warfare to achieve it caitlyn thinks shes noble because her family gave them fresh air in the first place even though they control their ability to breathe she claims to have given them their ability to breathe a right that they took away by building the city of piltover in the first place i pulled you all up from the depths gave you a taste of topside and fresh air  silco s e\n\nthe similarities dont end there cait actively pushes away the ones she loves so that she can continue doing what she thinks is right in the same way silco tried to disconnect himself from vander cait was willing to hurt and push away vi in order to maintain her hatred and achieve her goals she was willing to shoot at a child in order to defeat her enemy in the same way silco was already willing to kill children and let them be a casualty in his war against piltover cait in s is on her way to becoming the next silco he takes over the mantle and position of vander while she takes over the mantle and position of her mother\n\narcane demonstrates however that one clear difference is that silco cannot stop fighting because the suffering of his people would only continue or worsen should he end his violence caitlyn however would only give up her own vengance it shows that oppressors are the ones with the power to walk away from their hatred vengeance and pain and enable peace it is the privilige of those who already have the power that can give it up for the betterment of everyone silco cannot heal because to do so would be to forsake everyone in the underground the reason that vanders peaceful option cannot succeed is because it never puts the onus on topside to change their ways they would happily continue as if nothing needed to change the base violence necessary for change silco was a product of the violence conducted against him and the people around him just as caitlyn was a product of her priviledge as silco summarises in jinxs head in s e the cycle only ends when you find the will to walk away and as vi so helpfully explains in this same episode who gets to decide who gets a second chance the answer is those in priviledge the ones with the power to walk away and not continue suffering\n\nthis is where the silcocait parallel reaches its full potential when caitlyn loses her eye she patches it up a scar that exists that she can live with and live her life normally afterwards silco on the other hand has his eye corrupted and never chooses to lose the eye instead he wears his pain like a badge of honour he lives with the hate inside him eating him from the inside out showing it off to everyone who sees him slowly devouring his humanity using jinx to fuel his hate and anger rather than letting it die caitlyn got to walk away silcos hatred and anger killed him\n\ni hope you guys enjoy this analysis as much as you liked the ekkoheimerdinger post i appreciated the support for the first one a lot i hope this one is as interesting and insightful let me know if theres something else you want to cover and as before let me know if you read it or enjoyed it i loved responding to everyone who left a comment\n\nbe back with some more analysis soon",

        "i think by the end of the series the only thing i feel was lacking was a true super hero moment from vi she is scrapping in every fight but she never saves the day or flips the odds she really feels like the furthest from her original character bio than any other character from lol although her and jinx probably got the closest visual representation of their initial designs \n\ni was actually surprised we got the real viktor with the voice and all super satisfied with the way things turned out do i wish it was longer sure absolutely i loved the ride however if this was truly the way they wanted to tell the story i cant argue with that  \n\nalso this was a happier ending than i thought we would get all things considered",
        "it feels like the social commentary has been thrown out the window \n\nthe zaunites fighting for piltover and dying in enforcer uniforms genuinely how did we get there like did we miss out a whole episode caitlyn gets no consequences for her actions as a fascist and gassing up zaunites like she lost her eye thats it them putting sevika on the council only for her to get dirty looks ok its showing how there is still a power imbalance but why did we not extend this further hell sevika did not say a single word this whole act none of the zaunites apart from the mains said anything did we forget about them trying to gain independence and freedom i guess we did the social commentary is what got me here in the first place and now its like it was never there\n\nthis is for act  but how the hell is vi calling others traitors when she was wearing an enforcer uniform and gassing up her own people like  months ago how does this never get brought up again when i saw that scene i actually started laughing vi also let cait hit her multiple times and proceeded to have sex with her when she was still worried about what her sister might do to herself or other people she lets cait walk all over her all the time she doesnt even care that she was fucking maddie she just has no agency whatsover in this relationship the final line in this show is her calling herself the dirt under caits fingernails oksure that took the writers  hours to write this was one of my favourite characters my goat is so washed",
        "i just want to drop this in the bucket of observations\n\nin his speech to viktor jayce makes mention of viktors imperfections including his limp as essential in making him who he was its a truth of life that suffering and trauma are a building block of who you are after it has happened which is a tough pill to swallow when people would rather be rid of it or better yet have it never have happened its a natural human response and the root of viktors goal of a world without pain or suffering  but its jayces point that life contains suffering as part of its essential existence without trial life is endless stillness a world devoid of entropy and life itself its all very buddhist and i love that \n\nthe note i want to make that this parallel would have fallen flat to the audience and maybe viktor during most other points of the series jayce is a genius with his heart in the right place but he comes from a world of privilege as opposed to viktor and thats always been the main difference in how they see their dream of hextech used different flavours of protection but jayce tells this to viktor after coming there with his own limp with a brace to mirror viktors own \n\njayce had to crawl up from nothing a literal pit eating garbage and putrid water to stand next to a man with all the power mirroring victors journey prior to season  to come to the academy with jace its why when they meet in the finale theyre finally equals in every measure of their humanity and have shared experiences \n\nthey have always shared a dream and their mutual brilliance is undeniable but they come from two very different places at the end of the story they could truly see eyetoeye and unmake their dream together because they finally shared their goal in its entirely \n\n\nanyway i love this show a",

        "gotta say a bit disappointed by the ending the art was incredible like genuinely some of the best animation i have seen ever\n\nbut idk the whole glorious evolution vs free choice conflict felt super tropey to me and also rushed also vi and jinx are like irrelevant to the plot in this season and not to be that guy but for a show with considerably more female main characters than make mcs the fact that the plot was resolved by only the male characters felt weird\n\ni think s is a solid  and at least the first half of s is also a  the rest i would say ranges but probably averages out at like  pretty good overall",
        "now that its all over i can say it sure went in a completely different direction than i thought while we were waiting for s and looking at the s intro i was  expecting a civil war storyline with jinx leading zaunn and vi with cait leading topside piltover it became pretty obvious as soon as viktor was revived but i certainly didnt expect a worlddominatinghivemind subplot and i certainly didnt expect time travel vander or mels lil kidnapping side story \n\nwhile i overall still enjoyed what i experienced i cant help but agree with many that this needed another season or a longer season \n\na civil war story line could have made for a whole s where lots of the side characters who got a fair amount of screen time but were barely named like isha could have gotten a lot more development whatshis name fish guy with maddie bat guy with sevika loris etc\n\nthen s would have been ambessas crusade and viktors hivemind which would have been building slowly in s",

        "i mean its definitely cool and i enjoyed the ride and im glad a lot of you did but  i am not a fan of scale that big unless its executed to perfection this was not this act felt very heavy on fanservice but without any emotional setup or even follow through and i think it did a bad job at concluding arcs of a couple characters i think there are bits and moments in the writing that are absolutely incredible but dont get the setup they demanded s jinx is pretty different from s act  jinx who is so vastly different to s act  jinx and not saying thats an impossible jump but i dont think we were given enough of it a lot of the story plays out in montages i intensely dislike the latter time travel bittwistwhatever would gladly discuss more in a spoilers section",

        "so they imply jinx is alive but i still think its a weak ending for her character it just happens out of nowhere and i feel like is thematically weak i just feel like the sisters were the emotional core to the story and they got neglected a little bit by the ending that was very stop the apocalypse \n\nwhich is a shame because i feel viktor and jayce got a really cool ending i liked that jayce ended up finally having his breakthrough and then using compassion to help viktor realise that perfection isnt a real goal",
        "sooo vanderwarwick had four death scenes stabbed by silco vi crying over his shimmered body isha shooting jinxs gun jinxs grenade and since isha didnt manage to kill him using three hex crystals he probably still isnt dead after the grenade nice also it strips ishas death of its meaning  \nnext the caitvi prison cell scene was out of place in my opinion the worst possible timing and location  \njust as i feared loris was given no personality and he appeared only to get killed off  \ni cannot stress enough that ishas sacrifice was pointless it bothers me so much  \nand jinx she apparently pretends to die and she does it for what exactly literally leaves everyone and everything behind suddenly is not suicidal and goes for an adventure on her airship  \nkinos death was barely touched upon so was the black rose situation and so many other things also what happened to heimerdinger viktor or jayce so much surface knowledge and so many loose ends\n\nit all feels so random to me i dont know what to think about the ending",
        "jinxs death felt super shoe horned in i expected it and we all saw it coming but the way it happened just seemed reallyanticlimactic and meaningless in the long run like a last minute  hey we forgot to kill off an important main character moment that was just slapped on",

        "so why did jayce even try to kill viktor in the first place  \n  \ni mightve gotten it wrong or missed something but essentially in the alternative timeline jayce gets to talk to a viktor that regrets what hes done and sends him back to prevent it from ever happening\n\nthe win condition for jayce was just to talk soul to soul to viktor with his humanity rejected state gone in our case blown apart by ekkos bomb thus enabling them to just explode away viktor wiping out the threat that he represents\n\nbut the moment jayce gets back instead of even trying to talk to a viktor that has not yet rejected his humanity and showing his vision to him he just instantly kills him then refuses to talk to him twice\n\nat this point it just kinda seems out of character either future viktor is a dick and then it makes sense that jayce acts like this towards him back in his timeline or future viktor is good which is the case and then jayce just fucks up multiple opportunities causing viktor to allow singed to remove his humanity thus making it so jayce has to go through with the whole noxian battle shebang which ends up killing many just to be able to get the opportunity to break his humanityless state",
        "i actually really enjoyed the last season despite the plot being quite dense maybe even too dense at times im a bit lost of some of the black rose stuff though when mel said i see your face deceiver who was she was mel just saying she saw her ulterior motives",
        "jinx is alive\nwell i watched the clip of the explosion a million times jinx when she moves quickly with the shimmer there are pink lines left which you can see a second before the explosion silco also told her that if she wants to end the cycle she has to leave but not in the sense of killing herself its possible that she escaped a second before the explosion in order to survive and be able to disappear arcane is over but there are a lot of other islands in lol so they can extend her story to other islands thank you for your attention",
        "all ive been for the last  hours is depressed",
        "this season was by all accounts great television but doesnt live up to season  for me i found myself confused a lot of the time especially by the black rose and mel being a mage subplot that could be on me not watching intently enough though idk \n\nmy main gripe however is everything with vander i absolutely hate fake out character deaths and this is one of the worst he had a perfectly tragic send off in season  only for the writers to bring him back in a way that felt unnecessary he comes back for like  episodes out of the blue and then is immediately killed again without sharing a single significant character moment with jinx or vi seems like he just came back as a plot device to get vi and jinx together again and it really took me out of the story",
        "arcane giving me the worst post showmovie depression in a long time",
        "we all know that jinx is alive because of all the hints however its uncertain if vi knows anything it seems likely that vi has a hunch her sister is still alive\n\nafter the events at the finale wouldnt the first thing vi does be to look for jinx and ww and see if there are any bodies not finding anything would likely lead her to believe that jinx is alive but has chosen to break the cycle especially after jinxt told her about though theyre worlds apart they are still connected\n\nthis could explain why vi is humming at the endshe fondly remembers the good parts of jinx the sister she used to know jinx is slowly rediscovering those parts of herself in season  and continues that journey after leaving in the blimp",
        "removed",
        "did anyone notice that their is a kite attached to the airship at the end \n\nthats why you see the end  in jinxs writing fly by real quick \n\nyou can see the sunlight sort of reflect of the string attached to the airship to the kite \n\ni havent seen anyone mention it so far",
        "coming from someone who knows essentially zilch about league of legends and the universe as a whole i absolutely loved this show stating the obvious the animation was just absurdly incredible the music phenomenal the characters the world the vaing and most importantly the story was just simply amazing\n\nmy only complaint was the pacing between seasons  and  season  felt rather rushed with an urgency to fit everything in where season  gave you moments to catch your breathe and digest what actually just happened additionally maybe im just sorta dopey but i was slightly confused at times regarding specific characters motives towards the end of s such as the black rose i gained full clarity after reading peoples thoughts online re watching arcane and whatnot but i definitely lost track of some character motives during my initial watch still absolutely incredible show a definite must watch",

        "so with all of this said and done im not satisfied by that ending on its own there are individual portions that i liked viktorjayce ekko getting to be a hero mels barrier magic vi and cait but as a whole it doesn feel like a complete story it feels like pieces of many stories that didnt entirely come together as neatly as they could and didnt all end in a firm conclusion theres far too many open ended threads for what is a series finale\n\ni really really liked episode  i like seeing cait and vi reconcile i liked jayce trying to save viktor but i just cant find myself to like the whole final act",
        "jinx is actually on the ship at the end and flying off to wherever the next series is going to be trust me",
        "last two acts should have been a one long  hour movie or perhaps add  more acts for the pacing\n\nact  episode  was phenomenal the last two episodes was just fast paced with no mention of isha i felt that there should have been more reconciliation in their tough lovehate relationship and more emotional tuning \n\ni felt that the season ended in a rush to give an introduction to the vast world of runeterra",
        "i thought episode  was great but left far too much to accomplish in only two episodes  episodes  and  felt incredibly rushed  i was disappointed by a lot of what was missing and confused by a lot of what was shown instead\n\ncaitlyn never apologising to vi is so jarring to me  she never says shes sorry for what she did to her nor does she attempt to explain or justify her actions as piltovers commander  children were being sent to stillwater for heavens sake  vi should care about that a lot  \n\nthe sex scene came extremely suddenly and vi should be concerned that her sister is going to maybe kill herself  the scene itself was good but it didnt feel deserved and the timing seemed inappropriate\n\nthe situation which lead to jinxs death heavily hinted to be a fake out but still felt incredibly contrived and unnecessary\n\nambessas motivations didnt make sense to me anymore  why did she want to bring viktor to the hexgates  did she believe viktor would spare her and allow her to command his legion of evolved drones  i thought she was supposed to be smarter than that\n\nviktors plan and motivations werent clear to me all i knew was that the stakes were very high  why did he need to get to the top of the tower  why did he go from i will evolve all who are willing to trying to evolve absolutely everyone  \n\nif all jayce needed to do was talk to viktor and show him what was really important why did he kill him in episode six  why not have that conversation then while viktor was still acting reasonable\n\ni think i would have enjoyed the season more if there was no black rose arc and no endoftheworld slash threattohumanityitself arc either  black rose and mel having superpowers didnt feel necessary or particularly relevant to the rest of the plot and its removal could have given more time to flesh out interpersonal conflict between characters like vi caitlyn jinx and ekko  fighting the end of the world makes the fate of individual characters seem less significant and detracts from the themes surrounding relationships politics and inequality which are much more emotionally engaging\n\nepisodes   and  each made me cry  i didnt cry once during episodes   while that is far from the only metric of how compelling or enjoyable the story was i do think that act three was emotionally stunted as a result of trying to tie up too many stories in too short a time and the fact that i was feeling confused the entire time certainly didnt help",
        "yes i agree the season would have benefitted in splitting the ambessacaitlyn and viktorjace stories into two separate seasonsadd a few more episodes allowing the story to breathe and not having important scenes off screen \n\nbut ultimately i did still enjoy the final act the overall story was neat it was just chaos in getting there and you have to catch all the small moments to keep up",
        "my only major disappointment in the ending is that we dont see how zawn and piltover solved their conflict sure they fought together against an outside threat and it brought them together but this bond is not sustainable without further discussion which im sure happened as we do see sevika in the council but the whole premise of the first season was the very real political conflict between these two regions and the ways to approach it and i feel like we dont get a satisfying resolution for this personaly i really hoped they would show at least a glimpse of ekko leading and developing his community ideas he started around the tree and spreading it across the city also as it resembles an emerging genre in science fiction solarpunk which i think wouldve been a good message to end the show on also cause i think ekko is the best fit to lead that society to a good future but i guess ill have to settle with my imagination",
        "is no one gonna talk about how isha just dies and then is basically never mentioned again except for a single flashback",

        "ive done nothing all day and cant get over how sad ekkos story was in the final act i honestly believe that the au was more cruel to ekko than it was to jayce in the long run now jayce did go through hellish events and it clearly changed him but it was also used as a spark for him to change and rewrite the future of his own universe ekko was sent to an au where nearly everything was perfect vijayce and by him being within this au he got to experience what a life with people who he cared about were still alive and most important among them was powder because even though jinx isnt dead within his universe he learns what couldve been he also got to experience his first kiss which is heartbreaking within itself but this all comes with the understanding that jinx will very very likely never be powder ekko got to experience everything that couldve been and he chose to let it go only to end up alone in the end his final scene imo showed that even though jinx wasnt fully powder he still deeply cared about that side of her ultimately this is just what i could personally interpret for the character and of course hell always have his big sister in vi but even then every champion that was confirmed to be alive had someone besides them expect for ekko fyi among the  champs that died i personally believe that  of them are pretty much unknown heimjaycevik and jinx is unknown but leaning more to being alive ambessa and ww are cooked though",
        "im curious on your guys thoughts on how the pacing was handled personally the season was good but it felt very plot driven and as such kinda rushed a lot of elements im curious if anyone else felt the same",
        "tldr setting up the entire show characters and storylines around what seems to be a brilliant social commentary on division oppression cycles of hate and then just abandoningleaving no comment about all said themes is incredibly frustrating\n\ni think im like most people in this wow that was an absolute masterpiece but it just doesnt feel perfect state a third season or even  more episodes really couldve made all the difference again i loved it the art music fricken sound engineering on my home theater system was nuts characters but agghhh \n\nof all the things to be disappointed by for me by far its the failure to further explore piltoverzaun dynamics im not saying the show is responsible for taking a stanceoffering a solution but almost all the social commentary aspects from season  and early s just kind of got tossed out the window that oppressive regime dynamic was exactly the driving force behind all relationships and storyline in s it all became about magic and mystical time travel stuff so much so it got hard to even see it as an allegory for technologyinnovation i mean the world building was so incredible shimmerdrug production stop and frisk riots finding a political savior in jinx terrorist in the eyes of the other side balance in protection vs violence gang behavior and heck even viktor as a hypothetical curealldisease is such a sickly society couldve provided so many outcomesresolutions for us to think about now what as dumb and hot headed as vi is she never takes a stand with her people becomes an enforcer and lives the richprivileged life we dont actually see any characters effectively change their stance about the other side all the division and tension magically goes away uniting against noxus one time was enough \n\nagain dont expect or even want the writers to come up with a and this is how to achieve world peace but if a core theme of the show is division and oppression you cant just abandon it make it get slightly nuanced then boom big war mecha magic viktor jesus mutant wolf bad save the world then they continue to exist in society is ridiculous and so unsatisfying fighting against someone else doesnt resolve your differences putting one person on the council doesnt explain how the two sides see each other differently so much left unexplored whether you see the ending as eventually they unitedfound peace or division and oppression is inevitable we really dont see enough of why that result happened",
        "i know nobody else is thinking about this but did vi ever use the force field her gauntlets had ever again",
        "the best way i can describe it is  moments of greatness the pacing was a bit off and the only i thing i truly didnt like was that jinx and vi kinda took a backseat it didnt really feel like their story anymore that said\n\nekko and alternate universe powder was the best scene of the season \n\ncaitlyn  no scopes ambessas troops while using them as body shields is one of the coolest things ive ever seen \n\njayce taking the hammer from his own corpse after fighting for weeks just to survive is an awesome concept \n\ncaitlynvi in the prison i dont fucking care then the porn music rolls \n\nthe watercolors of vi and powder as kids in vanders mind was fucking beautiful\n\nso many moments of greatness but season  remains the goat",
        "the writers making vander wake up  despite every other viktor puppet dying  solely to have that cliche hanging over the edge moment with jinx and vi  just ass the more i think about it the more annoyed i am",

        "great show just  questions thats itching my brain meat in an annoying way\n\n loris why dude was just some random homeless drunk he acts suspiciously while listening to vi vent so it kinda implies he maybe has some history or will be narratively important maybe for some reason cait lets this homeless drunk join her elite strike squad of enforcers to hunt down jinx then loris kinda disappears for most of act  and  and then he reappears in the final battle to die ignobly he doesnt even get a heroic sacrifice or anything why was this character introduced he could easily not be in the show and it wouldnt have made a difference is he from the game\n\n maddies betrayal huh yea i saw that she sensed that cait still had feeling for vi maybe she even knew they fucked and felt betrayed but thats slash the cheating exs tires sort of situation not join the enemies invading your city sort of thing ambessa mentions again about the hazards of professional entanglement are we supposed to infer that maddie was a nox sleeper agent all along if so were there some subtle hints about it that i missed\n\nedit rewatched the end of episode  when ambessa promised to help piltover with nox soldiers maddie was the first enforcer to copy the noxian salute while looking straight at cait like you should totally trust that warlord yea maddie was a nox sleeper agent the first time i watched it i assumed that was just maddies naivete",
        "why didnt viktor  jesus tell jayce in the hell world to convince viktor  herald not to become viktorultron if the didnt tell jayce to kill him viktor wouldnt do the evil plot and none of the other bad stuff character deaths fe would need to happen",

        "it needed like  more minutes to be honest wrap out a lot of dialogue i really felt like this was a budget thing",
        "i wish they never introduced isha and spent more time on the  other plot points they introduced by that point just to kill her off and never bring her up again just weird",
        "why did the story devolve into multiverse shenanigans and yet another mankind assimilation plot what couldve been one of the best shows of all time was marred by generic and uninspired writing still great but they definitely didnt stick the landing",
        "i think this was a classic case of the fans being waaaay overhyped its still a  or  good but because season one was an  good they are very dissatisfied which fair enough i guess personally i think that the plot points were clearly well thought out the character arcs were well thought out where it missed was thematically they completely dropped the juicy poor vs rich stuff and all the moral ambiguity for a more traditional good vs evil plot which is still a fine and fun time also i agree that they could have used a few more episodes still am satisfied",
        "season   absolutely no notes as perfect as a show can be\n\ns act   they somehow managed to make it better chefs kiss \n\ns act   left me a little worried some choices that lacked their usual solid writing and character motivation but i kept hope that it would be revealed in the third act\n\ns act   truly disappointed the whole thing fell apart for me couldnt believe that this was what they had been building everything up to some solid moments and beautiful animation of course but lacking the emotion and writing that made me obsess for hours on end over the first season",

        "honestly that cant be it man that cant be it",
        "i hate that i feel this disappointed but there were so many big deaths that at the very least i wish they wouldve just let us sit with for at least a minute or two before bulldozing forward like a shot of jinx with ishas helmet or jinxs statue alongside vanders or jayce and victors statues at the academy something to give their deaths the respect they deserve",
        "this doesnt feel like a series end or even a season end i just have more questions and its supposed to be the sisters story but they didnt get a conclusion especially if jinx isnt actually dead",
        "honestly cant believe it ended like that  it definitely hit some high points episode  especially but it just didnt hit quite the way it should have toward the end  i will probably have to sit with it and see it in its entirety but damn not the conclusion i expected",
        "i need a few weeks to process this so many thoughts about it \n\n\nso many good things and so many things that seem really questionable at best i really wish they didnt have to cut this episode run time",

        "very touching timeline between ekko and powder sadly ekko and powder cannot exist with vi in the picture as powder is far too dependent on vi and vi is dragging powder along doing risky jobs despite powder being more suited to a place like benzos shop with ekko\n\n jayce might be the biggest victim in this whole plot wants to save his crippled friend and his crippled friend uses jayces inventions to cause the apocalypse in every timeline all the meanwhile jayce is hated for his flaws by the fandom god forbid he show human error and persevere\n\n ambessa got character assassinated holy shit\n\n singed is truly a mastermind lmfaoooo",
        "i thought episode  was really well done loved seeing what could have been from ekkos perspective heartbreaking scene when he left the alternate timeline\n\nfrom episode  onwards i have mixed feelings first of all the vicait scene was just completely out of the blue like your sister might be about to kill herself and you suddenly feel the need to make out in the dirty ass cell its obvious fanservice but it just didnt sit right with me i also think the black rose arc was tied up quite messily i guess they just randomly show up mel just accepts their pendant after being held captive by them for a while mind you then they appear randomly again to tickle ambessas mind and then mel goes super saiyan on them and then ambessa dies this part just didnt make sense to me\n\ni did like the feeling of seeing the time loop almost finish itself with jayce kneeling in the same position as his petrified self and ekko of course jumping in to make viktor wake up and jayceviktor finishing up what they had started with hextech\n\nbut my final gripe is the way they killed jinx come on can we at least have them talk a little for some last closure before vanderwick goes apeshit and vi really not mentioning jinx dying before they cut to the last scene they were the centerpiece of arcane and i would have expected a little more building on their relationship in the last episodes",
        "season  was very accessible to casual viewers season  much less so it seems that there are lots of things people who know lol lore wouldve understood way better like the black rose which gets absolutely  explanation whatsoever",
        "my man ekko balling like kirby from ssbb",
        "the conclusion is that if powder wouldve killed vi at the beginning everything would have been better everything",
        "i need someone to explain the black rose and mels arc please im so lost on it",
        "i think ambessa and the mel arc messed up the pacing of the season it started with vijinx and viktorjayce and it should have focused on it throughout both seasons rather than trying to shove in some c plot that took so much time away from the characters people actually cared about",
        "idk but heimers foreshadowing of the hex core and trying to prevent jayce and victor from developing it seems like hes been hopping from timeline to timeline trying to save them from arcane  also hes immortal so  is it possible",
        "okay was the redhead guard a plant from the get go or did she turnget turned to ambessas side due to vi or another factor",
        "i really feel like the show was building up jinx to grow out of her pure destruction phase into something more and maybe become a major leader of the underground but the writers just gave up during the last act\n\nthere was a lot of potential for her character being hinted at throughout the show like sevika saying she could unite the lanes or viktor saying her talents can be used to build rather than destroy jinx herself says she like to fix things   \n  \nthe constant imagery of jinx being a symbol of freedom and of zaunite resistance combined with her cult following made me believe that jinx would eventually become the defacto leader of the revolution after the prison break i was sure the show would focus on jinx being pressured into a role of leadership but that was derailed for the vander side quest vanders reintroduction is fine enough but after his death and especially ishas death the writing takes a turn for the worst\n\nisha was built up as being jinxs hope her reason for living when topside attacked the commune causing isha to sacrifice herself protecting jinx i thought that was the last straw this is what would push jinx to act to rally the whole underground and strike back at piltover its a bit cliche but i thought this would at least push jinx out of her inaction if nothing else than to honor ishas memory by being the jinx that she died believing in \n\nim not saying that jinx would take vander or silcos place that would probably go to sevika however i do think she couldve been a leader that brings people together taking the best qualities from both vander and silco vanders compassion and silcos ambition a fox and a wolf she didnt even have to be a war leader i just wanted to see jinx  help her community in her own way of her own free will\n\n my last hope was ekkos speech save jinx from suicide no matter what happened in the past its never too late to build something new someone worth building it for i hoped prayed even that this was a call for jinx to help make the underground a better place for people like isha silly me it was actually to build an airship to save the world from le glorious evolution to add salt to the wound isha is never mentioned again\n\ni may have set myself up for disappointment but when the show keeps hinting that jinx would become the hope of zaun i was expecting someone who was more than a good gun i just wanted jinx to rise above her old life as a weapon and be someone more",
        "vi kinda forgot she had a sister",
        "what the fack was that the last episode was rushed no closure none hello",
        "they accidentally animated someones fanfiction of arcane instead of whatever the writers actually meant to write",
        "on the one hand that ending was rushed as fck and im kinda disappointed that they couldnt stick the landing on whats otherwise a perfect series\n\non the other hand season  set my expectations way too higheh its the same thing\n\noverall i liked season  not as much as season  but thats expected at least there was killer animation fun songs insane fight scenes interesting characters and a sesbian lex that was definitely fan service but i appreciated nonetheless\n\nnow lets start placing bets on how long it takes before mel comes to lol",
        "you see character development was very subtle this season it all happened offscreen",
        "does anybody else think that the music felt off somehow this season\n\nit technically has all the same qualities that season  did lots of variety some small and some big artists all linked to pivotal segments in their episode\n\nbut in season  it felt like the songs were made for their corrosponding scene especially i am the monster you created while this season it felt like they just grabbed songs from the artists existing portfolio and slapped them onto the show\n\nlike what does america and champagne in plastic glasses have anything to do with the prison scene",
        "just finished tonight  overall i think the show was still excellent but for fuck sake why do companies spend so much money just to rush shows  its so fucking stupid",
        "dude this felt so rushed you can tell just by the music choices as a lot dont match the scene they are tied to not to mention how mid the ending was not enough screen time for what they were trying to go for everything felt really quick after episode  i kinda wish there would have been a th act to wrap things up more neatly also why no mention of isha like none at all",

        "i think it was more that jayce also died in that timeline otherwise it doesnt really make sense why he couldnt join ekko and heimer there",
        "i think its less about vi dying and more about jayce not getting to continue his research after a kid dies in his study as tragically funny as vis death creating a utopia would be i think the implication is more that having any kid die to a hexcore explosion in that study just so happens to be vi in this timeline means that jayce gets the boot or goes to prison for storing and working with dangerous materials and thus never creates hextech which results in an idyllic nohextech worldtimeline \n\njayce almost got severely punished by the ones in power in season  for merely having the materials cause property damage  he was let of the hook for that but having the property damage and a dead kid around makes him much more difficult to recuse for his negligence of safety it doesnt matter if its vi powder claggor or milo  jayce and hextech development would both probably get absolutely ruined they caused child casualties before even getting off the ground floor at all",

        "theres this misconception that zaun went to shit in our canon universe because silco and shimmer but that is just a part of the issue the hextech and the progress piltover made created an even bigger class divide between the cities silco with shimmer and zaun going downhill is a response for all the progress that didnt trickle down to the people on the bottom \n\nin that universe theres no hextech piltover doesnt have so much power and money and influence theres a more equal footing for the fight even in season  jayce and viktors conflict regarding the hextech started because it wasnt used to help people in need but only to make the rich richer \n\nits capitalism and class divide the piltover gets stronger while zaun has to be more reactionary a cycle of inequality and violence",

        "ok guys next analysis post \n\ncait and silco two sides of the same coin privilege and oppression \n\nive not seen anyone really compare these two characters that have such incredible parallels i only noticed it in e when i saw the pattern connect \n\nsilco is a seperatist fighting for freedom in an oppressed society so that the people he fights for will finally be free of their oppressors a man born in the gutters and coming from nothing experiencing the worst of the world cait is the child of a noble family one of the most powerful families in piltover and fights for herself to prove her worth and explore the world that shes seen nothing of only experiencing the softest parts of society and craving more \n\nthese two characters cannot possibly be more different in background and starting setting silco fights for his seat at the table whilst cait inherits it both intelligent resourceful tactical and prefer outmaneuvering to brute force they both end up the defacto leaders of their armies in a fight against an opponent blinded by rage and willing to sacrifice their humanity to succeed in their goals it is no coincidence that both silco and cait use the toxic gas of the underground to fight against their enemies and control them compare the scene in s e with silco and the chembarons with cait in s e turning off their air and releasing toxic gas to get what they want silco is trying to keep order and prevent a worse outcome keeping zaun united at any cost caitlyn is doing it to avoid a full out invasion of zaun both have noble goals but are willing to induce chemical warfare to achieve it caitlyn thinks shes noble because her family gave them fresh air in the first place even though they control their ability to breathe she claims to have given them their ability to breathe a right that they took away by building the city of piltover in the first place i pulled you all up from the depths gave you a taste of topside and fresh air  silco s e \n\nthe similarities dont end there cait actively pushes away the ones she loves so that she can continue doing what she thinks is right in the same way silco tried to disconnect himself from vander cait was willing to hurt and push away vi in order to maintain her hatred and achieve her goals she was willing to shoot at a child in order to defeat her enemy in the same way silco was already willing to kill children and let them be a casualty in his war against piltover cait in s is on her way to becoming the next silco he takes over the mantle and position of vander while she takes over the mantle and position of her mother \n\narcane demonstrates however that one clear difference is that silco cannot stop fighting because the suffering of his people would only continue or worsen should he end his violence caitlyn however would only give up her own vengance it shows that oppressors are the ones with the power to walk away from their hatred vengeance and pain and enable peace it is the privilige of those who already have the power that can give it up for the betterment of everyone silco cannot heal because to do so would be to forsake everyone in the underground the reason that vanders peaceful option cannot succeed is because it never puts the onus on topside to change their ways they would happily continue as if nothing needed to change the base violence necessary for change silco was a product of the violence conducted against him and the people around him just as caitlyn was a product of her priviledge as silco summarises in jinxs head in s e the cycle only ends when you find the will to walk away and as vi so helpfully explains in this same episode who gets to decide who gets a second chance the answer is those in priviledge the ones with the power to walk away and not continue suffering \n\nthis is where the silcocait parallel reaches its full potential when caitlyn loses her eye she patches it up a scar that exists that she can live with and live her life normally afterwards silco on the other hand has his eye corrupted and never chooses to lose the eye instead he wears his pain like a badge of honour he lives with the hate inside him eating him from the inside out showing it off to everyone who sees him slowly devouring his humanity using jinx to fuel his hate and anger rather than letting it die caitlyn got to walk away silcos hatred and anger killed him \n\ni hope you guys enjoy this analysis as much as you liked the ekkoheimerdinger post i appreciated the support for the first one a lot i hope this one is as interesting and insightful let me know if theres something else you want to cover and as before let me know if you read it or enjoyed it i loved responding to everyone who left a comment \n\nbe back with some more analysis soon",
        "you just verbalised what ive been thinking well put",
        "ikr i actually liked season two but was hoping for more screen time for my girl  did her dirty",
        "he had a name",
        "to me arcane really excelled where it kept things small\n\nvery much agreed it was also visually more impactful when they had seperate scenes and sets that could be set up with interesting shots it still looks gorgeous style wise but theres very few actually cinematic moments compared to s because they just had to bang out action after action s was full of this is a perfect wallpaper moments s still had them but much less\n\nif anyone could explain what was going on in the black rose subplot and with what mel did in the end\n\nsame with viktorjayce we just get to see something magicarcane happens that fixes everything maybe it can be explained by people deep in the lore and rewatches but to the casual viewer it seemed impossible to understand",
        "yeah i agree season  is so good because it focuses on a few characters in their towering cities and how life differs from each other plus mostly focusing on the story of jinx and vi the main characters you can see and feel the world building happening \n\nwe get to the end of season  and its gotten so huge that viktor is a second away from mind controlling the entire world into zombies what happened to the story focusing on the sisters kinda just lost the plot for me",
        "i know im replying in two minutes after you posted this lol but i have no one to talk to about this yet   \ni have no idea how to piece together the why in this show and i know that the general population who do not know lol lore will probably think its alright however the people who know the lore are going to find this really confusing i mean to me it just gave a lot more questions to be asked about what happened",
        "yeah i think my big complaint here is that the main story from se was about this conflict between the rich and the poor in piltover the plotline about hextech seemed like the b plot with jayce  viktor not even introduced until e the main purpose of which was to highlight the a plot because the advances in hextech continued to only benefit the rich even further\n\nand that entire conflict is resolved by what a common enemy showed up everyone put aside their differences and so its all good now\n\nwhat about the gasses poisoning the lanes what about the huge wealth inequality what about the police brutality and corruption\n\nall we get is that zaun gets a representative on the council now and yeah the implication is that thats just a first step and theres still a long way to go and that the conflict will never really be over because the story is never over life goes on ect ect but it still feels like the a plot got trampled over by the b plot at the last minute",
        "that was a heartbreaking episode\n\nthis whole series has just been poor powder time and time again\n\narcane is the tragedy of powderjinx",
        "alternate universe spin off maybe",
        "she has the schematics the gems and the platform its far from over besides the final shot of our ekko is him sitting on the roof and thinking about alternate powder he can go to her himself",
        "teased the implications of episode  in this timeline instead of jayces hextech leading to viktors evolution powder has the gems and now has seen the potential thanks to ekko and heims unknowing meddling\n\nviktor reaches evolution becomes god and sees that evolution was a mistake he seeks to create a paradox in which he never evolved and therefore across all timelines gives jayce a different rune in the powder timeline jayce seems to have died in the explosion but powder is the one taking the role of kicking off evolution its a doomed timeline we just dont see the results because we get only a short frame of reference",
        "take it away zuko\n\ngifgiphyxoyieslsbynkt",
        "she was delulu she just wanted power to defeat the black rose next show will prolly be about noxus and mel will appear again so we may discover more theres also a canon novel about ambessa ill have to read ir",
        "destroy black rose she was doing all that to protect her family at the when her child killed black rose mage ambessa felt a relief that her child could defend herself against them then she passed out in peace\n\nit is what viktor said at the end of act the things that make us great are also the things that makes the world chaotic our emotions will always pass through reasoning \n\nambessa was blind by her emotions she was not able to realize that she was causing more harm than anything to her family her emotions told her that she was right when it was actually all wrong",
        "there  isnt",
        "yeah it seemed for some reason they really wanted season  to be the end most shows drag on too much but this was the opposite",
        "i just finished episode  and had that exact thought almost word for word the contrast in pacing from season  to  is very upsetting it felt like somebody on an adhd ramble pitched this season and they just went with it",
        "they left heimerdinger behind and nobody asked what happened to him",
        "she got shafted a decent amount of screentime this season tho",
        "i mean it still was very good it just didnt really lead to anywhere much instead it just became another sacrifice to getting the plot done",
        "its insane why did they not show us that conversation",
        "this is was kills me the spirit of the show was always about the cycle of violence between two peoples on both a personal and societal level and i know the writers know this its beautifully alluded to multiple times i ns and s but they just ran out of time \n\nthe fact they had to resort to the most cliche image of a greater threat swarming up the building was kinda hilarious \n\nstill a great show and s will be an all time classic but this one just feels like  steps down to merely good",
        "especially because arcane shines when its about the relations betwern characters and their sacrifices this overbearing safe the world plot at the end feels sooo out of place",
        "okay youre the first person i agree with i thought every ending was good except the sisters i was weirded out that they werent involved at all in defeating any final villains jinx shouldnt have died because she already wanted to die\n\nof course jinx survived because of the whole hexgate escape hatch in caitlyns plans and the airship flying away at the end but still",
        "season  was perfect because it was first and foremost a personal story between two sisters everything else was just the supporting branches in this one sisters plotline get sidelined to open space for prevent the apocalypse plotline i am genuinely disappointed in that regard because when they focus on personal stories they do an amazing job sadly we had to cram a save the world storyline to season",
        "i think so \n\nsomething that covers the time skip and gives the character a bit more time to breathe \n\ncaitlyn going full caitler and then being redeemed was rushed her forgiving jinx didnt feel earned \n\njinx didnt get a proper ending",
        "not even i genuinely think  more episodesone more act woulda done wonders specifically between two and three",
        "when they went in for the head touch i genuinely thought it was going to be a kiss",
        "agree it was also kinda cute i still think theyre just bros but i cant denied was kinda romantic",
        "imagine if it just suddenly led into a version of the vi and cait cell scene\n\nnoxian soldier staring gayyyy but doesnt look away",
        "not to mention in the cell where she was locked up",
        "its funny because people wanted that and it came out of nowhere",
        "my mom said arent they sisters",
        "deleted",
        "bro maddie getting ricocheted was the funniest fkn thing in this whole series",
        "because the writing tanked they cared so much about how cool everything looks but the emotion behind the war just felt bland",
        "not gonna lie i wanted to like it so bad but it just felt off are we gonna pretend that vi wasnt about to break down that jinx was literally about to kill herself the scene works when you dont have any context of what happened right before or whats happening after",
        "boning cait took priority over her sisters mental breakdown ig",
        "no youre so right that was weird as fuck dude your sister is literally about to kill herself and you wanna eat out your gf in this dingy ass cell",
        "i disagree honestly vi once again attempts to do the right thing and give jinx another chance and jinx betrays her by locking her in a cell and running off obviously this time its because shes in a really dark place but still there are only so many times you can slap away an olive branch before a person stops offering it to you\n\nvi also didnt throw herself at cait the second she walked in the cell shed clearly been in that cell for hours thinking about how stupid she was for trusting jinx again and how she let cait down to the point she expected a lecture so i think when cait came in and revealed that she knew vi would break jinx out and did nothing to stop it it confirmed to vi that the old cait was back\n\nso what we have here is\n\nyears of pent up feelings  massive show of forgiveness and trust  imminent existential threat  quite possibly the last time both of them will be alone together before a massive battle",
        "dude i feel like the sisters just arent allowed to coexist in any universe tragic",
        "i feel like jayce also died in that explosion in that world and thats what led to hextech not developing and peace between zaun and piltover",
        "not just that her dying literally fixes all of zauns problems lmfao poor vi",
        "fr why the fuck didnt ekko get assimilated other characters were knocked out too why did he survive the time travel when one of the only established rules of the magic system is you cant go more than four seconds back \n\nfor that record why was the magic never actually explained why does it do good things for some people but fuck up other people is hex magic intuitively programmed to simply do whatever would make for the most aesthetic shot on camera possible is it only there to make a cool fight scene \n\nspeaking of fight scenes why was cait able to fight like a beast against ambessa even though shed been stabbed in the stomach moments earlier why was mel able to harness and target her magic so adeptly and with such precision if shed only just got it when did she learn how to black rose teleport people who was that black rose lady anyway and why should we care \n\nspeaking of caring why was viktor this allknowing being who in episode  said gave an entire love and hate are two sides of the same coin diatribe somehow convinced by jayce going but ur my partner and i care about you why did the writers leave jinxs death open ended why were we expected to care about it when she literally tried to kill herself multiple times mere scenes ago\n\nwhy did any of this happen what was the takeaway the moral the lesson the question im supposed to ponder how it is the case that every character was constantly stating the theme out loud and yet i have no idea what to think or feel now why did they pay  million dollars to have a perfectly good story about humans in a deeply unequal society completely swallowed up by some marvel mcu magic bullshit gahhhh",
        "yea that really jumped the shark for me was hard to care about anything after that",
        "completely agreed im very disappointed that they just dismissed the class struggle and worldbuilding of the city for a world ending event where it felt like things were just happening for the spectacle",
        "this finale felt like the opposite of the season  finale it was all action and almost no character it really feels like vi snd caits issues were barely touched on when they couldve been a great source for drama likewise i think cait and jinxs interactions were underwhelming",
        "black rose tells mel that ambessa killed kino and that shes a sus liar while they want only good for her and theyre are her true siblings\n\nmel thinks alright im a slave to my new destiny now black rose it is\n\njayce tells her that shell never be a passenger and can leverage her own decisions\n\nmel confronts her mom and ambessa says she didnt kill kino black rose did \n\nso whos lying in the end she sets up a trap for black rose using ambessa as bait thats why she calls br the deceiver and either implies that she sees through her lies or maybe its a seed for a new plotline and she actually saw br face and knows how it looks like\n\nambessa still randomly dies that is weird writing\n\nthat was my interpretation",
        "yeah i dont think it matters if shes dead or not right now the show ended there their story ended there too and it was such a cliche dead not very arcane way of their part lol",
        "i didnt know how to explain the mixed feelings for s but you hit the nail with plot driven vs character driven feels like no one can really shine when things happen so fast",
        "im glad a lot of people have the same take as you do this  change was just too much for me s was a whole different story i really wish theyd just give us a consistent story from beginning to end\n\ni agree with you that there were so many low stakes moments between characters that felt way more impactful than the s madness \n\nill always remember vis face seeing unhinged jinx for the first time\n\nive already forgotten half of the final battle which on paper shouldve been x more impactful",
        "i think its less about viktors disabilities and more about his obsession with them  i think the implication is that he saw his leg and his disease as personal flawsas if they somehow had a say in his objective value as a personnot just as undesirable conditions",
        "viktor is a character i relate to on such a fundamental level to the point ive had friends message when they watched the series just to make the comparison i wont go into too great detail those parallels   \n  \nlike him i also happen to have a pretty debilitating permanent condition that cannot be cured and will eventually catch up to me and have at times had to rely on a cane though i try not to as much as possible  \n\n\ni found jayces speech pretty condescending and if it were me i wouldnt have come to some kind of cosmicshifting realization because of it",
        "yeah when he said your leg your disease they are not flaws they are what made you who you are  \nmy mind went to picturing someone giving that speech to someone who has cancer or another terminal illness\n\nlike bro no  \njust no",
        "the best moment of the series to me was when jinx saw vi hugging vander and she said hes your dad too  the emotional impact every time jinx and vi had a conversation or a touching moment was where the show soared disappointed the third act lost that completely",
        "yeah i was like wait literally what about that scene had they been working toward what did that scene encapsulate about their characters and relationship jinx selfsacrificing herself because vi wanted to save vander like what theres barely any dialogue",
        "lets have jinx kill herself multiple times in the set of scenes preceding the one where she actually kills herself thatll make it really impactful and unexpected",
        "viktor wanted to eliminate suffering by eliminating the choice to create suffering he was seduced into that dream by the hextech which just wanted to feed the future we saw with jayce in e was the one where it was allowed to complete the evolution with perfect shimmer win the war and then basically eating everything he was made a villain by his mind being more hextech than him evidenced by sky the real her we know its other peoples consciousnesses in there telling him that he wont miss her hes not the viktor she loved and he didnt see how he was being manipulated to a greater end",
        "she didnt even look like she wanted or intended to die there",
        "having rewatched s right before s released i felt like i accidentally started watching a fan fiction instead",
        "it was my favourite episode of this act but i have to agree that considering the fast pace of the show it probably shouldve been cut down to expand on other things",
        "tru that felt forced af lmaoo",
        "lmao no would have been a valid response by zaun after all the shit they had suffered",
        "secret good fourth sherlock episode arcane act",
        "i guess the moral the story is its not about committing war crimes its about committing the most war crimes to get the happy ending you want\n\nnow excuse me going to hurl",
        "plot device to give jynx hope and then make her depressed again",
        "thats exactly how i feel ill watch the show many number of times again but the last two episodes will always be the weakest of the show doesnt matter that theyre highest quality when it comes to animation and cinematography",
        "this made me cackle out loud way too real",
        "isha kinda represents everything that went bad with the show and i truly hate saying that instead of being her own character she was just used as a plot device to get jinx to a particular place i was sad when isha died but they didnt treat her death right",
        "won the game by proxy farming classic singed",
        "everyone are playing checkers while singed was playing d chess",
        "dont just do war crimes sell your war crimes to everyone",
        "i think the message is that if youre gonna do warcrimes do them in the name of science and horde key knowledge so that even an enemy army is willing to let you go for your knowledge\n\nsee the real life examples of nazi and japanese scientists getting off scotfree since they agreed to give their warcrime science knowledge to america",
        "i fucking hope so always been my favourite character and favourite character design and then they just dialed the design up a few notches in this arc",
        "i think it was viktor at that point or jayce as part of viktors amalgamation of souls",
        "i dont think powder is gonna mess with the gems she seems to just keep them as a reminder to vi",
        "i think its possible but her putting the pendant away seemed kinda symbolic of her not touching the gems\u00a0 they just stayed in her drawer",
        "this would be fun af to play and horrible to play against lmao having a pool of time that you could rewind at will could be a fun pve mode",
        "i hate how this response sounds but im  agreeing with you arcane has shown that the show runners are going to give you a lot of story with very little  see the mel flashes of gold hinting at her magic before we actually got to see her fully realize her powers\n\ncould we have gotten more downtime in between story beats sure maybe but it would have cost time and money to ultimately add nothing to the plot the show was fast paced and demanded your attention as well as your understanding that while the individual story it was telling ends here the broader universe it encompasses will very much continue to live and breathe as you mentioned it yourself arcane wasted no time explaining everything to the viewer and as much as its being criticised for it its probably my favourite part about it",
        "there is no other reason for that pink flash to be there good catch",
        "nah this is the main canon timeline for us and they ded",
        "i think she was implying he was about to lose the last of his humanity and therefore he wont miss her because he will have no ability to experience any emotion only reason",
        "nah it was the fact heimer was there for so long and had a chance to basically avoid the two sides becoming so hateful",
        "i agree it didnt have to be vi a literal child dying during that moment would also shift piltovers view of the explosion from petty thiefs causing havoc and holding dangerous equipment to holy shit a kid just died and likely create some compassion towards the undercity",
        "i think it had to be vi its not just piltover not getting hextech  silco and the whole shimmer problem would still exist but we see that hes mellowed out and hanging around vanders bar now i assume that this silco heard of vi dying and paid vander a visit out of respect for felicia kickstarting a chain of events where zaun isnt a drugged out shithole run by chembarons",
        "also no vander death which changes things a lot\n\nzaun with good leaders instead of chem barons",
        "also heimerdinger recognized jayces criticism of him and actually got off his ass to help improve peoples daily lives \n\nwhen he tells ekko he wont fail another student i liked that alot what could have been if the people in charge gave a shit and jayce didnt have to push so hard for improvement",
        "to be fair their heimer was disconnected as good a time as any to push when theyre a man down",
        "jayce looked useless there probably sold all items decided to troll",
        "i mean its fairly obvious she would be ambessa was already introduced and mels story this season has had new champ written all over her her final look is plainly a champion design\n\nwhat i wanna know is if well finally get victor in wild rift now with accompanying arcanegod skin\n\nwouldnt mind that final jayce outfit as a skin either",
        "good she looked like shed be an interesting champ",
        "and yet didnt get nearly as much screentime as she deserved",
        "loved it when vi said maybe the real arcane was the friends we made along the way",
        "literally goosebumps",
        "my favourite was when jinx said because youre a vi",
        "he played the very long game and won",
        "jinx its the same airship she wanted to fly in season  the nd hint that she survived the third being that you have a shimmer explosion right before she dies with vanderwick so i think she got out through the tunnels and left piltover thus breaking the circle of killing",
        "holy shit how the fuck did you catch that",
        "i honestly think the story would have been better had they entirely removed anything to do with noxus or black rose heck even killing off mel would have done wonders for freeing up time the story would have been way more compelling had it just been about a civil war between piltover and zaun and nothing else",
        "yup no clue at one point near the end i said to myself oh probably cause its french that i just dont have the philosophical capacity to understand what the fuck theyre talking about \n\nvisually stunning emotionally evocative loved the battle scene but totally lost on what the take away was they crammed in so much and explained nothing and left me with a head full of fuck",
        "something magicarcane happens that fixes everything\n\nits possible that someone with deep lore knowledge can explain what happens on a technical level but as someone with no such knowledge myself ive never played the games i think its pretty straightforward what happens on a storylevel\n\nvictor was going to assimilate everyone in order to bring peace to the world jace talked him down by making him realize that such a peace would also mean an end to any progress\n\nyou can probably explain more of the hows of the exact magics involved with a deeper understanding of lore but thats just window dressing what really matters is the character moment of jace getting through to victor",
        "i dont think thats the direction\n\nshe had and has her own ekko\n\ni think the reveal was either just a nod to her being a sentimentalist or that she knew how dangerous those gems are and didnt want to provide more because she lost vi because of them\n\nif anything im more wary of what happened to heimer that unceremonious disappearance looks like he just ended up elsewhere",
        "im also disappointed that there was a lot of background focus on the firelights deputy leader the bat guy who sided with jinx and sevika because he thought ekko was dead appeared at the war council meeting then turned around and walked away but possibly came back  its hard to tell  yet never even saw ekkos return or interacted with him at all\n\nalso the whole thing with jinx becoming a symbol of zaun a potential unifier sevika pushing her to take silcos place and fulfil his vision the jinxers then none of this even being a thing again when zauns independence was the entire driving force of the series \n\nthen theres ambessa why was she even there and what was her plan again i cant remember if this was ever addressed nor do i have any idea where the mages came from and what their deal was or what ambessa even did to earn their wrath or how mel turned out to be one and was inducted into their order or what that deceiver did or what the whole thing with the red vines turning gold was supposed to be and why that even killed ambessa \n\nwhere did singed even go when hes largely responsible for everything that happened from his experiments with shimmer speaking of that wasnt caitlyn mentioning learning the true nature of shimmer something that happened a few episodes ago that also wasnt addressed again to creating and experimenting with all the monsters that got unleashed on piltover no repercussions or justice of any kind\n\nalso jinx had no real reaction at all to losing isha nobody did like she never even existed\n\ni just dont get any of it",
        "jayce and caitlyn also didnt interact again despite being childhood best friends and having so much shared history there was no acknowledgement at all from her either over his return or death",
        "it saddens me to agree i liked the second season a lot but compared to ss absolute masterpiece a i really liked it is a significant downgrade",
        "i think season  needed to be caitlyn and ambessa as the main antagonists and then all the viktor arcane stuff being season",
        "its so funny people keep saying the time skip when no cap theres quite literally like  time skips in this fucking season hahahah \n\neveryone of those music video intros to the first batch of episodes were tall time skipsmessy exposition dumps",
        "i want a directors cut there was def a kiss copium",
        "their relationship kind of in a weird way reminds me of guts and griffiths from berserk justuh without all the really really bad shit a deep caring love towards another person but one that isnt necessarily romantic in nature",
        "and immediately after she was suffering a mental breakdown  panicking about everyone in her life being dead as much as i wanted that scene to happen man that was not the way to do it",
        "freud is spinning like a gyroscope in his grave rn",
        "i think thats the point where sevika might have realized that silcos methods had fundamentally unraveled the sense of community that used to be part of the undercity smeech was all too eager to hand over jinx and at the rally shes meeting with factions not a mostly united front as it was when vander was around",
        "yeah i think people are not really taking vis perspective into account here\n\nvi tries to free jinx only to have jinx lock her in from vis pov all she knows is that jinx is refusing to fight with her and is running off to do her own thing\n\nshe feels like a dumbass for trusting jinx not knowing that jinx is in fact suicidal vi has a breakdown of her own for both being betrayed by jinx and also betraying cait only for cait to reveal that she trusted vi and knew she would release jinx",
        "that sky scene was so good that simple no you wont had so many implications about how far gone viktors humanity was honestly probably one of the best scenes in the show in terms of storytelling because it says so much with so little",
        "they made singed gameplay cannon lmao",
        "a few notches the girls got enough power and beauty shes at least a demigod by this point she broke the scale which is saying something given how high on it she was before",
        "it was vayce who released the hammer",
        "honestly i think some significant part of the negative voices on s i heard are often due to missing stuff like with the time skip between st and nd act  they didnt do a big black screen with  year later and people got immediately either confused or started talking about pacing apparently to grasp such concepts as city in turmoil or new young leader is lost and seeks guidance needs a whole ass episode or something or the failure to grasp that the role of some unnamed or barely named characters that were woven into the story the green guy officer the bearded guy who found and drunk with vi the pianist the jinxer that weve seen in another reality is precisely to flesh out the universe and the struggle of the whole society without spending long hours on unecessary lore drops\n\nthe second big part were mostly people who just for some reason had some expectation on what the story should be and then getting disappointed because it wasnt that thats always the burden the followup to something big is going to bear though",
        "eh why show the schematics of the hex gate with a little notation theres a vent where jinx fell this isnt a i hope she is still alive but rather like pretty sure she is otherwise its a weird little detail",
        "honestly theres a lot of room for most of them being alive\n\nheim it explicitly showed blood leftovers of when ekko was testing the  second thing but when he fullon time traveled heim just disappeared \n\njinx obviously alive with the schematics blimp soundtrack and end text \n\nvictorjayce they could be anywhere with that arcane bs",
        "thats such nice character development for heim it also explains why he didnt want to leave he probably got attached to this new timeline where he prevented thing from going to the shit",
        "except he was only there for  years quite frankly its probably a combination of many different factors\n\nvi dying in piltover and marcus being the first to find her probably had an effect on him given his daughter was around  posttimeskip and so he had recently become a father himself\n\nvis death leads to no hextech due to its dangers regardless of whether or not jayce dies\n\nzaun people being partly victims in the accident means silco doesnt have to move up his timeline with shimmer which gives more time for things to move in the background\n\na lack of hextech keeps the social divide between zaun and piltover to a minimum too\n\nand then a few years in heimerdinger wakes up and gains memory of all the issues in zaun and how his inaction was also partly the cause of it",
        "yeah any of the kids dying there would be a huge story in piltover  both because jayce is connected partially to councilor kiramanns family linking to the elites in the upper city and because any of the four potential victims are connected to vander linking to a big influencerleader in the lower one sacking punishing and pinning most of the blame on jayce is the first thing the council would try to do",
        "lso no vander death which changes things a lot\n\nmaybe im crazy but why would vi dying in the job change any of the silco bullshit the production of shimmer and him planning to attack him happened entirely isolated from the hexgem robbery theres no reason to think he wouldnt have made the same attempt",
        "she didnt even say a word this act lmao her last line was in episode  i guess",
        "also you have a jinx screen break sort of thing right at the very end where the screen distorts and gets the jagged lines drawn over it and stuff only shows up with jinx so",
        "league brain damage",
        "idk i think the point was that she had unrealized potential and vander didnt want her living her life at the bar our ekko also told her that she could do so much more",
        "yeah sevika was pretty much cut out of the story\u00a0\n\nfelt like the writers abandoned whatever they were originally trying to do in favor of their bosss orders or something\n\nisha def is what made jinx want to off herself but theres so many questions\n\nhow did vi cait and jinx escape the noxian army after es ending\n\nwhy was ambessa cool with destroying humanity\n\nwhy did the black rose release mel\n\nwhy were they bringing victor to the capital area and why was it important to stop that it didnt matter where victor was\n\nvictor has metal arms why does the mage that gives jayce the stone have tattooed arms\n\nit felt like they forced a lot and abandoned whatever plot they originally had",
        "i am still surprised why many people isnt asking about the ambessa thing like bro what did she want exactly \n\nshe fought zaun piltover viktor warwick daughter blackrose\n\n  \nshe fkin fought everything for what",
        "jinx had no real reaction at all to losing isha\n\nshe fucking killed herself dawg",
        "season  definitely had some highlight moments but mostly viktors fall i think was done poorly\n\nfuture viktor sent jayce back and then jayce killed past viktor which quite literally led to viktor fulfilling the murder everyone and replace them with cold machines problem in the first place\n\nprejayce viktor was totally willing to speak to jayce about the fucked up future he saw and the two of them could even have prevented it together instead jayce shot viktor and he woke up as the glorious evolution and then they acted like future viktor sending him back justified that\n\nlike hell no he couldve shown viktor the path of humanity without blasting a hole in his chest",
        "yeah i agree with that i think if the martial law plot was the entire season they could have ended the season with the end of act  caitlyn finally realising the hurt shes causing and betraying ambessa who then decides on war meanwhile the viktor stuff could mostly be in the background and the salo death scene could be towards the end where we realise viktor is evil \n\nthen season  can focus on that stuff they could have worked on caitlyn and vi properly getting together caitlyn forgiving jinx and some jinx and ekko stuff",
        "season  also needed to be for heimerdinger and ekko heimer especially feels like he got shafted massively to fit everything else in\n\nwarwick and singed could have been fleshed out a bit more too but generally speaking season  needed to be for zauns plot to continue while ekko heim jayce and victor explored the arcane more building up to victors revolution in season",
        "im so glad yall get it too like maybe i just get it because im a lesbian but it just didnt feel that out of place to me\n\nalso in other shows movies books etc sex happens at one of the bleakest points of the narrative because characters are desperate and dont think theres any way out and are looking for any scrap of comfort and love they can its not fucked its a common story telling beat lol",
        "jaktor",
        "yeah jinx is the one that may actually be alive i have been rewatching that specific part and its too sus and has no reason to exist otherwise and warwick may also still be alive even tho vander is dead",
        "yeah i think he definitely got attached and fell in love with what he created but then instantly got guilt tripped by ekko haha",
        "i think the implication is that silco got vanders letter left in the mines amongst other things that changed for that alttimeline",
        "i imagine jayce probably went to prison which prevents hextech being created also stops the enforcers taking vander away which stops the monkey bomb scene playing out etc",
        "also the music that was playing in that scene was powder humming from season  i think",
        "the jagged lines read the end",
        "comicbook rule \n\nif theres no body theyre not dead",
        "i got the impression that after vis death silco and vander reconciled\n\nfrom the shocked face of the enforcer that came to arrest kids during the heist i got the impression that the event changed a lot\n\ninstead of topside being angry and cracking down people saw a dead child because of inequality this could have changed topside response to compassion"

        "show is absolutely amazing in so many regards but one of my favorite things is its really managing to sell the constant escalation of conflict everyone is emotional and worked up from years upon years of division and it comes through so strongly ambessa fucking with things is obviously not helping but it makes so much sense the way things play out and it really enhances the tragedy of these stories that you can see so many lynchpin moments if jinx hadnt gotten to fire that rocket if the council had been left with a couple more people with more level heads on and on it goes and at each point its like if everyone could just sit down and talk they might be able to move forward in a positive way but that just cant happen",

        "such a good episode havent seen the other episodes yet and omg i have some things to say \n\n caitlyn i love how detailed caitlyns actionsresponses to her mothers death it was really clear for the viewers to see how she was trying her best holding up her tears and acting strong so they wouldnt see it as a weakness even mel sees this right away the death of her mother was the reason she blamed herself for it by not ending jinx sooner she clearly disregarded all of her emotions after that and from now on will act on logic without her feelings getting in the way thisll be fun because the only thing that will make her think again is vi \n\n mel for the last years ive always thought she would die right there and im so glad she didnt which made me relieved and i thought she was going to die a second time right there at the podium i wouldnt handle it if that happened that would be devastating especially because of what jinx said right next to jayce \n\n vi and the big guy the moment i first saw them the big guy reminds me so much of vander in a way that it was such a comforting feeling because vi has someone that shared the heavy feeling shes been having from all of her problems i know im gonna love their friendship duo \n\nthats all for now i really enjoyed it and i cant wait to watch more",
        "as much as i love the show the whole maddie this is what cait said about you behind your back about your heart and bravery to do it by yourself and whatnot was so far the only time the writing has felt really overly forced to move the plot along and resolve the conflict \n\nits not unheard of to happen in reality but it didnt feel like there was any buildup for that resolution it was a problem created just to be handwaived away quickly likely for the sake of time i can see this as being a place cuts might have happened in which case im not entirely sure it added much to having the conflict in the first place yeah people sometimes lash out and dont deal with grief well but i think that couldve been demonstrated otherwise like thru some temporary binge drinking alcoholism maybe even from caitlyn instead of from vi as a subversion of the drunken brawler stereotype \n\ni thought the resolution with jayce and the council dialogue was much better executed personally for comparison i only had  major issue with season  and this is pretty minor for me so far after only watching the first episode",

        "so annoyed by caits shortsightedness i feel for her after losing her mother but her selfcentered vision makes me so angry how dare she ask vi to join the enforcers how dare she compare her suffering to vis losing two parents as a child and in poverty does not compare at all with losing one parent as an adult in a position of a lot of privilege",

        "im rewatching right now and man this episode feels so different in a good way arcane season  was always moving at a break neck speed because there was a time skip and so everything was always serious but theres something fun about seeing a somewhat humorous vibe when vi meets maddie and seeing her be somewhat of a drinker its like ur seeing another side of the character youve imagined for the last  years\n\ni also forgot how expressive the faces were or did they improve that its like you can see what the character is thinking even if they dont say anything also the inverse here starting and exploring piltover a bit more here over zain",

        "im a little surprised so many people are forgetting what happened in season one but i didnt realize it came out  years ago do you guys not at least watch the last episode of the first season when theres such a big gap \n\nanyway i hate that vi became an enforcer it just seems a little stupid because what reason did she have other than caitlyn it may have made more sense if they were closer or dating but theyre not its clear that they like each other if the caressing wasnt obvious enough but it seems out of character for vi to join the topsiders like that just for one girl even then she was so against it a day before but all of a sudden shes had a change of heart a little lame to me \n\non the other hand viktor being absorbed by the hexcore didnt make sense at first but considering he dedicated so much of his life to it i cant say im surprised the whole thing is so ironic because heimerdinger told them that this would happen but they claimed he was stuck in the past insane \n\noverall i liked the first episode even though there was so much thrown in our face im excited to see how the characters and their relationships develop and what will happen with jinx",

        "just started watching but going to say one negative piece first that i dont like the black cuts during the jayce carrying viktor scene after the explosion i understand what theyre going for but its pretty annoying personally",
        "didnt like it conflict between vi and cait was super contrived then immediately solved with a really awkward fangirl cop scene the fight scene was a breakneck pace in a bad way none of the shots had any time to breathe as one example that shot of fangirl cop in the car to drive the councilors away where the chemtank comes out of the smoke through the drivers side window would have been really cool and memorable if the entire sequence didnt last three seconds\n\ndeus ex noxus sucked youre telling me a javelin thrown from  feet away has more impact than an actual gun i thought the point of the chemtechhextech conflict was that piltover had to deign to use hextech violently in order to compete but apparently not also why even bother with the well go to war  but not with hextech subplot when the very next fight scene they give up on it if you need mel and jayce to seem antihextechweaponry just have them get outvoted on the use of it\n\nthis was the most endsovermeans episode of the show so far they needed a piltoverzaun battle with jayce cait and vi all in their league of legends canon story positions weapons included and they were willing to sacrifice the pacing to do it",

        "amazing episode my compliments of this episode would be longer than anyone would care to read\n\ni do have a criticism in my opinion this episode was unfinished the strobe effect that was utilized in the intro and the action sequence  into the episode was jarring and made the fight scene slightly hard to follow\n\nim not saying this made the episode bad however i just personally didnt like the way the fight scene had so many jarring cuts so quickly i feel like they tried to make it seemed stylized by repeatedly cutting to black as they did in the intro but i feel like that fell flat\n\ni still absolutely loved the episode when cate walked in and demanded the respect of the remaining  councillers was phenomenal i just felt like sharing my one hangup with this episode \n\ni think the rapid cuts was probably caused by crunch time and overworking of the animators given some more time to work on the show i am sure they would have filled in those gaps in the action sequence that are missing but at the end of the day the first season released  years ago and at some point you need to release the final product that is season \n\nagain i loved this first episode they released a great product i just wanted to share my one critique to see if anyone else agrees with me on this subject",

        "i watched s with my wife when it first came out we just rewatched s this week before going straight into s\n\nalmost immediately my wife who isnt a gamer or animation person was like  wait where did those giant shimmer battle suit people come from werent they just about to announce the independence of the nation of zaun the episode almost immediately launched into a giant bombastic battle scene and it was pretty much one of those after another youre telling me the shimmer lady who was basically just a black market boss suddenly turned into an unstoppable monster with a plasma chainsaw the battle suits who were a match even for hextech and armed enforcers all got taken out suddenly by a couple dudes with spears\n\nmy wife checked out of the show during se and i can feel myself doing the same seems like the maturity level of the series dropped by about a decade and its now an extended video game action cutscene for preteen boys maybe itll improve but the shift from s is really glaring at least the animation art direction and voice acting are still topnotch but looks like the story itself took a huge nosedive",

        "the whole plot around jinx rocket and the council room was super odd to me its a hextechbased giant rocket and it didnt even manage to destroy a single room \n\nany average reallife bomb can destroy a whole house with ease but somehow a superweaponized bomb in arcane cant\n\ni hope this gets addressed later cause i think that sucked",
        "pretty lame how mel and jayce magically survive with barely a scratch even though they were the closest to the window  bomb without any explanation if mel had activated a  shield it should have shielded the others too because she was standing between them and the bomb and her shield would have blocked the explosion from reaching the people in the back also based on jayce wondering about why he survived it doesnt sound like there was a magic shield involved at all",

        "the grief was really well done her expression as the casket was closing just trying to hold on as long as she could to seeing her mum",
        "that was such an excellent choice of artistic style the whole world being grey and lacking for any kind of detail save for a few points of focus is such an artful and powerful metaphor for the grief of that kind of loss and then yeah vis statement about how it just gets smaller but it never really goes away the va did an excellent job with the delivery to really drive home the pain in that knowledge",
        "cassandras funeral reminded me of the spiderverse scenes in gwens universe with the way the surroundings were drawn in their own style",
        "im positive the kirammans have staff and advisors you cant tell me these two especially in their current state are sweeping the floors making their beds doing laundry or cooking in their giant palatial estate theyre just not characters in the show",
        "vis observance even when shes drunk reads as ptsd hypervigilance to me i have it too",
        "my theory is i think theyre hinting at ambessa mels mom being the person behind zaun getting their shit together so fast wo silco cuz shes a machevelian war monger who would benefit financially from more conflict stepped in post silco vacuum",
        "all the ifs are pointless \n\nthe escalation is the consequence of a problem that the council ignored for years and let it fester\n\nthey ignored the growing inequality of the undercity\n\nthey ignored the desperation of the people living there\n\nthey ignored the growing influence of the people that took advantage of that desperation\n\nand they ignored the boiling pot that all of that greated\n\nnow it is too late and they have no useful cards left on the table\n\ncapitulation and trying to negotiate with the leaderless chaotic mess that is currently the undercity is pointless\n\nand escalation and attack will only lead to more deaths and more escalations\n\nit was inevitable by this point",
        "most definitely when mel says they must have had help from someone up here in response to one of the councilors asking how they pulled off the attack it literally cuts to a wide shot showing medarda staring disapprovingly at mel",
        "she comes in last minute to save the day before anyone gets killed she probably offered up jayce as the only one they were allowed to they obviously had a clear shot at mel and didnt take it it would be a plot hole otherwise tbh",
        "fuck i never considered that i assumed that was ambessa being intelligent enough in warfare to predict this shit happening to be fair the chembaron wouldnt take much fucking pushing after her son dying to jayce lol",
        "oh yeah pretty much",
        "couple of points that substantiate this theory she needs a war to occur to advance hextech weaponry development and testing for her own uses mel had an opportunity to be shot but was seemingly spared by the shot through the roof and again when she was in the toppled wagon medarda personally shows up to save the day but also directly kills the chainsaw mom tying up that loose end who couldve talked about how she was the mole lastly offering up jayce as tribute simplifies her ability to steer the council to further the war effort through mel and removes a barrier jayce and his vow to viktor to weaponizing hextech \n\nkiller first episode though unreal show",
        "yeah that scene got me its like her spine breaks when she drops the faade",
        "yeah looked like they had specially designed armor andor weapons",
        "i wondered if thats any character weve met before i thought it might be the giant tattooed characters we already see in the first couple episodes in s",
        "the guy vi was drinking with looked like an off duty officer to me he has the vibe of an old cop whos tired of the shit and he was probably out getting drunk because he knew the attack on the council was gonna wind up escalating he probably remembers the first war that got vi and jinxs parents killed and hes not looking forward to another go at that but otherwise i agree it was pretty rushed",
        "agree and they smell so much of your only role is to die at some points for dramatic effect that i struggle to feel close to them",
        "thats my only real gripe with the season in a perfect world they get a little more time per episode and they flesh out the strike team get more of the character moments they had in season  etc",
        "onboard with this especially after so many good character developments in season  this felt rushed shallow and very poorly written to me really hoping it gets better than this the level in season  was miles higher",
        "if only we had her new commander hat for the lil reddit avatars",
        "too cool for that im afraid",
        "i wasnt expecting the plotline with her and her son to come back but its oen of those things where like of course it did and it was fucking sick as hell",
        "who is renni",
        "my girl is ripped underneath that coat",
        "it seems like his name is steb i found it on the tft roster for set",
        "in case you havent seen it they also played the song during the recent world championship opening ceremony",
        "god it sounded so much like reznor and rosss scores it made me feel so hyped",
        "if there is one current show thats made and cut for linkin park its this one",
        "i seriously thought mel was going to die at the end right after we just found out she survives jinx lmaothen saw maddie and thought fuck this will be vis turning point into joining the enforcersturns out im not good at making predictions xd",
        "always has been",
        "that wasnt jinx who stood next to jayce before the attack that was the baronness whose son jayce had killed",
        "i love when shows do the whole sucker punch of you thought we killed this character at the end of last season but theyre actually alive and then we kill them in the first episode of the next season  it usually surprises me every time so i thought they were going to do it here and subverted it",
        "i called that big guy vander  as soon as i saw him",
        "i didnt really feel this way about it her assuming vi was joining was completely reasonable considering caitlyn fought for her so hard to doso and only caitlyn knows she turned it down at that point vi didnt decide to join until after the chem baron fight \n\nthe entire time vi is fighting w her feelings w caitlyn and her identity as a zaunite  and as the chembarons keep advancing shes pushed more towards caitlyn\n\ni do however wish we got more characterization of the squad besides just that interaction",
        "the scene with cait asking vi to join up was really badly written too imo each line felt forced and the pacing of the conversation was awful\n\ngood episode tho",
        "its strange because the attack during the memorial later in the episode seems like it would have convinced vi to join the enforcers anyway maddie acting like it was already a done deal that vi would agree to joining them did seem a bit odd did she know that vi had refused the offer or was she trying to convince vi by flattering her and telling her what cait did\n\nbut either way it was a nice moment even if it felt out of place as a plot device",
        "felt very sus that they had a chance to kill mel as she was giving the speech and instead pistol whipped her yeah seems like the mom staged things",
        "she absolutely has this malevolence but then again sometimes thats what you need in war you need an iron fist to sort shit out theres a reason culling in the animal world still exists  it has its uses when applied correctly her donning that mask at the end was great if the chembarons didnt attack piltover could weed out jinx peacefully but that plan got fucked up now we get to see the simplicity of brute force",
        "especially when it was stated someone must have helped them topside with the attack",
        "i remember someone saying before that it looks very similar to an item in lol that gives you a temporary shield which would answer jayces question about how he wasnt hurt he was in the radius of the shield",
        "agreed i feel like no one is acknowledging how this whole situation is by far the hardest on vi and vi is just taking it like a champ but it makes me sad and mad to not see vi break down be supported acknowledged for the fact that she lost her family and not only her sister but that her sister replaced silco as the leader of the undercity but in a deranged less restrained manner \n\ni was pissed off when i saw vi join at the end my love",
        "its very fast paced bordering on rushing but it still worked for me",
        "yeah i felt the same the pacing was going way too fast for me to be able to keep up with everything going on at the same time",
        "the pacing is kinda off its crazy to say  but its looking like it shouldve been  seasons or at least  acts",
        "exactly like caitlyns got the key then boom costume and character revamp",
        "yeah the art is by far the best part of the show and the story is okay too",
        "same its hard to get people who dont play league or like animation into this show but the ones that do give it a watch always tell me they love it",
        "its how i felt watching puss in boots the last wish like oh yeah people can actually try new styles of animation still i forgot that",
        "i found out that each model is digitally hand painted and all the backdrops are hand painted too really stunning stuff",
        "i assume it was because of viktor he was too wrought with grief and stress but also maybe has too many biases",
        "im pretty sure he also stepped down if im remembering correctly",
        "he was injured and probably tired himself out with all the forging",
        "isnt he the leader of the council or am i wrong",
        "arcanes characters always had amazing facial animation and amazing animation in general but season  definitely stepped it up somehow arcane is probably the best media ive ever seen incorporate body language and facial expression so so well for communicating information to the viewer",
        "wearing a headset while watching this show feels orgasmic to my ears i always adore good sound design and this show one of the very few that had me rewinding to hear sounds again god done so good",
        "of all the scenes this episode to loop  thats how you know the animation  sound team nailed even the tiniest of scenes",
        "i just recently heard about arcane and decided to give it a try i binged watched the first season over the weekend while getting chores done just finished watching this episode it just picks up where the first season left off im now feeling pretty lucky that i missed it all three years ago didnt have to wait",
        "this i came in blind realized i almost forgot everything that happened leading to the stunt pulled by jinx in the final episode of season one now that i went through the previous season again  regained many of the contexts episode one just hits so much harder",
        "or just watch the man of recaps on youtube he had the best recap of season",
        "brm at home while looking like vander which is ironic as theyre both voiced by jb blanc",
        "that wasnt braun",
        "hes a dude whos also crazy strong",
        "i noticed a change in vis mind about becoming an enforcer after the new character the enforcer with tan hair praised her and wished most enforcers had her bravery she felt like she belonged she felt respected among them",
        "vi joined caitlyn because she blames herself for creating jinx jinx even told her so not really joining them for their beliefs but she feels its her responsibility to stop the monster she created",
        "yeah man vi not only joining the topsiders but becoming an enforcer is kinda meh",
        "she joined the enforcers to protect caitlyn from jinx and also to protect jinx from caitlyn thats plenty of reason imo",
        "yes its singed the scientific with victor in season",
        "pretty sure its somewhat related to the horrific pollution in the slums same reason why some enforcers wear gas masks to filter the air in some way",
        "both were nowhere drunk i call bullshit lol",
        "well the maddie thing aged well",
        "agreed",
        "vi changed her mind after talking to that young girl and then the attack there was probably like  minutes between the scenes when vi refused to her with the badge",
        "she didnt want to but i guess vi reconsidered cuz for one her feelings for cait second seeing the rampage and sudden attack on the ceremony would make her join since everything happened due to her sister i guess she joined because she also wanted to get closer to jinx and stop the chaos caused by her \nthese are just my opinions  id love to hear other ideas",
        "i figure it put things into perspective for vi when she saw the upper citys innocents getting killed and why this conflict needs to end plus it means she gets her gloves back",
        "well firstly the new recruits who come upon vi clearly think that she is gonna join so caitlyn must not have said that she wasnt going to\n\nsecond a little bit of time goes a long way that combined with her feelings for cait and what cait said about if im to do this without you either way i slice it me or your sister come back in a box lead to her change this way vi can protect caitlyn while also ensuring the best outcome possible",
        "theres a number of reasons why it makes sense she sees it as an opportunity to protect caitlyn who is basically her rock at this point not even speaking romantically even though that aspect is there but who else does she even have now powder was the one thing she held dear and shes gone now outside of ekko why bother returning to the undercity\n\nso that plus marcus is dead and he was really the guy being bribed and pulling strings so i think theres an angle of trying to make change from the inside and help end the needless oppression from enforcers toward the undercity plus maddie quoting caitlyn saying if every enforcer had a heart like vis we could take on noxus itself made her realize theres potential for influence on her behalf \n\nalso growing up she was always looking for any reason to vilify piltover but shes come to realize theres some goodness there through caitlyn and to an extent jayce so her view isnt as black and white as it was when she was younger",
        "the heavy is the crown theme playing when she makes her appearance alongside the enforcers terrible terrible energy  if they even bothered with the moral grey area here with jinx at large and a threat to others they couldve just had her commit to tracking jinx on her own while she figures out what to do with her connection with cait and her moralsidentity it wouldve been cool to see a team that she came up with on her own maybe crosspaths with the two sides as she figures out her place in between but no copcity babyyy  give me a break",
        "to me even story wise it doesnt make sense it feels really weird",
        "deleted",
        "there are a lot of animes that can pull emotions out of me attack on titan comes to mind",
        "removed",
        "removed",
        "it refers to caitlin and her sudden weight of responsibility her grief and rage and how that combination takes her from a goodhearted reasonable person to an unchecked martial authority puppeteered by an unhinged power hungry tyrant on a self righteous path to recover her family and wealth through sheer domination i believe its a play on the phrase heavy is the head that wears the crown and refers to the weight and seduction of power in the face of hatred and violence it can really be applied to many of the characters who find themselves in a leadership position and feature in the first episode and especially as we see more of their stories unfold in later episodes but i think it most heavily centers around caitlin and her begrudging rise to power",
        "heavy is the head that wears the crown any person who has been in a significant leadership position knows the meaning of that statement a slightly modified version can be found all the way back in william shakespeares henry iv and is often used to talk about\u00a0the burden and difficulties of being a leader",
        "im not sure but the music in the end where they show vi helping the enforcers the lyrics to the song is heavy is the crown so that might be the reference it might also be because for caitlyn the crown is heavy because she has to lead after her mother",
        "they played a song called heavy is the crown",
        "dont know if theres something else but its the title of a recent linkin park song which they released with a league of legends themed music video parts of said song also play during the episode",
        "same thing with the awkward cuts when jayce was fighting off chainsaw maam then elbowing her then pulling out the tube i thought he was imagining it for a moment i dont understand the stylistic choice",
        "i agree that the conflict with vi was solved too quickly but saying it all came from a fangirl cop scene feels reductive i think seeing cait almost get killed by zaunites made her realize escalation was truly inevitable\n\nhard disagree on the fight i think it was done wonderfully as usual\n\ndeus ex noxus actually follows real life pretty well sure throwing a halberd  ft beats a gun any day but how long did that guy have to train to fight like that and how long does it take to learn how to shoot a rifle thats why crossbows became so popular it took a lifetime to become a master archer but only an afternoon to become a master crossbowman\n\nalso throwing a halberd is not at all the same level of power as gauntlets that can crush rock or laser guns with infinite ammo idk why youre implying the noxus dude is somehow portrayed as stronger than hex tech\n\nalso this is speculation but im calling that ambessa helped the zaunites infiltrate the meeting and then set up her people to help save the day to cement the militarization of hex tech and increase the peoples trust in noxus",
        "i feel like it could have been a good conflict\nhave salo suggest using hextech to storm the under city and crush them\n\n\nmel can say no with cait backing her up in that its just a single individual responsible\u00a0\nsalo can push back saying that even if it is one individual the only way to find jinx is to flood the undercity with enforcers and crush all the chembarons any small group will be easily ambushed in enemy territory and without hextech they will be defenceless unless theyre in overwhelming numbers\nshoola can concur mel can concede as long as hextech isnt used\n\n\nin vi and caits scene cait can explain the plan vi will obviously be against it and insist its either a not going to work andor b going to kill a lot of innocent zaunites she can put forth the case of her using hextech to settle it without massive casualties cait can tell her its not possible as all of the new hextech stuff is locked up and only the council has the authority to unlock it she can push the point home that theyre not going to do that for some random street thug from the under city which puts the onus on vi to join the enforcers vi will obviously decline at this point\n\n\npersonally i think the vi  lauris scene as well as the other enforcers is weak id much rather vi went to a bar to drown her sorrows and overheard some enforcers talking about the attack mix some stuff in thats relatable maybe one of them knew a guard enforcer who had two daughters or something idk vi can talk to them a bit keep the line lauris says asking if she knew someone in the attack the morning can have lauris getting picked up by other enforcers and one of them can mention the memorial to vi\n\n\nits an asside thing but i think the memorial scene is strengthened if its a lot larger of an event with a lot more enforcers present the chem mechs should slaughter them get a couple people from the bar killed too maybe add some kids running away make it personal imo this moment is vi and jayces turning point their deep personally held beliefs need to be challenged vi needs to want to join the enforcers after this and jayce needs to be thinking if we dont use hextech as weapons more innocent people will die i just wasnt really sold on these facts\n\n\nkinda sa spoilers i also would have made a few changes around the noxus saviour i would have made it that the chem mechs began failing or something even with the explanation that it was a setup it doesnt really explain how noxus spears can pulverise chem mechs id also have spray painted some jinx style graffiti on the mechs really sell the false flag\n\n\ni feel the scenes after this are a bit messy the emotional beats are all pretty good but the motives are mixed vi is arguing that the invasion should be called off but she doesnt really argue her main point if she had hextech she could stop jinx i also think caits dehumanisation of zaun is underplayed she should really hammer home that she does not know how to fight such an underhanded and morally unscrupulous enemy by conventional means\u00a0\n\n\njayce and mel being left out really weakens the whole point to me they are the two key deciders on hextech being used and the show completely skips over them making the decision to change their mind cait and crew just show up in the next scene with hextech weapons i think a scene with jayce and mel talking this over maybe in the same scene as cait and vi maybe not jayce should have changed his mind having witnessed the slaughter of innocent people and the enforcers near inability to stop it mel can be weary about it still suspecting foul play but ultimately relent to her soft spot for jayce and a lack of evidence to her suspicions\n\n\nthe rest is basically the same cait puts forth the strike team plan i think my previous suggestion on vi meeting the enforcers strengthens it a bit these arent just some random enforcers vi happened to meet theyre people with a grudge against zaun who were in some way personally affected by the attack on the council and who were first hand witnesses to the remembrance day massacre\u00a0\n\n\noverall im still really enjoying the series most of what i suggested arent that big a divergence from the series as shown i just think there needed to be a bit more emphasis on the motivation thats causing a lot of our characters to shift their fundimental world views in such a small span of time",
        "i liked it but have to say i agree with all you said i hope the rest of the season isnt like it",
        "yeah im glad other people feel this way arcane is masterpiece level but there are definitely pacing and writing issues here and there that gets masked by the insane quality of everything else def fair to call out stuff that feels forced and fast just to move the plot was pretty noticeable in this episode for sure",
        "i liked it\n\ni just didnt like that the fight sequence made me dizzy with so many jarring and abrupt cuts i kinda feel like the fight scene was unfinished and they made do with what they had\n\nthe javelin throw working makes sense because medarda  helped orchastrate this attack to further her own personal interests in seeing hextech devoloped in a more militaristic style \n\nif medarda helped ensure this attack was succesful she most definitely ensured her and her team had weapons that would be sufficient in ending the conflict as well",
        "your setup",
        "episode  was like that for me",
        "nov",
        "that woman is the mother of that one boy that jace killed",
        "scene with the wolves is a setup for later",
        "ambessa medarda and a few of her people took them out its implied when everyone else looks over and the cameraview points to them idk about your second question",
        "i think youve nailed it i replied to another commenter who pointed them out because i couldnt understand the stylistic choice of doing it that way crunch definitely makes more sense especially considering how even a few seconds of this animation must take tons of work",
        "thanks for the spoiler this is only the episode  discussion post",
        "she experienced first hand the horrors and plight of the undercity and recognized that topside has some goodness through the likes of caitlyn and to an extent jayce and then maddie everything that has happened since meeting ekko and the firelights has happened within weeks maybe months at a stretch she has few trusting contacts still alive in zaun or piltover for that matter so what can she really do for ekko she has no home her friends are dead her sister is going crazy and her new partner is getting fucked over by jinx shes pretty much tied to caitlyn now",
        "shes lanes born and bred enforcers killer her parents and the topsiders were always apathetic to their plight\n\nenforcers killed her first parents silco killed her second the top side was apathetic to the plight of the lanes the lanes fell in line behind silco once vander died she has plenty of reasons to hold grudges against both her change in allegiance to piltover makes sense it has more to do with cate than anything else",
        "in which moment was that",
        "jayce accidentally kills her son during the raid on the shimmer plant",
        "dude lol its a mom",
        "jayce is literally the one that murdered her son using the hammer in season  shes not a good person shes complicit in the drug trade of course she wont blame the drug trade itself",
        "the random drunkard is hinted at to not be a random drunkard at all but someone more important to the story notice how when vi is fangirled upon by the new recruits he is pretending to be asleep and instead is paying attention to what shes saying\n\nalso theyre not the royal guard in anyway lmao i dont know where you picked that up they are part of the new task force caitlyn developed to combat zauns attacks on piltover and even if he were a random drunkard that just joined he did so becaused he proved hes fit for the task force he saved another officers life by using what was available and thinking on the spot even so he had all the chances to leave and refused to do so instead putting his own life on the line for the safety of others if that isnt worthy of being an officer i dont know what is",
        "i wonder why youre getting downvoted much of the dialogue feels out of character especially with jayce and i agree that theyre trying to force the depressing tone much too soon although its still a second season i expected some sort of exposition or buildup factor in the first episode maybe a flashback in the beginning",
        "the dialogue more specifically the rampant exposition from characters about their thoughts and feelings was so jarringly different from s the introduction to the so obviously significant group of guards was extremely hamfisted and they clearly had a problem in that they needed to quickly establish things that theyll rely on later but good god if this is how theyre treating the intro and setup to characters which imo was something that was a standout success in s they need to be saving time for something remarkable later i struggle to think what could be worth handicapping the entire development of core characters though\n\nvisuals were top quality like s which is a big win but alarm bells ringing from the very start for me",

        "i think its quite clear they did have a shield obviously her back thing glowed but also during the conversation between her and jayce he specifically mentions his guilt over being unharmed whilst viktor was nearly killed i thought it was quite clear in her reaction that she shielded them both",

        "and also salo completely ignoring her statement",
        "oh yeah thats actually fucking obvious once you pointed it out",

        "i interpreted it as a sign of no matter how vip you are we can always get close to you for the kill\u00a0\n\n\nbesides they dont know her relationship with jayce and he was obvous the  kill target on their list considering jinx goal is to spread full chaos and the other underground bosses goal aint the same but personal  jayce it makes sense to me at least",
        "exactly also if you notice mel wasnt armed and she could have been easily killed i think ambessa has infiltrated that child mothers that got killed by jayce sorry cant remember the name but on one condition no harm on mel",
        "sure but theres no excuse for why the hug between cait and vi didnt last  more seconds they separated too fast\n\njust nitpicking",

        "oh yeahh that made so much sense",
        "reasonable for maddie to think maybe yes reasonable for maddie to say it to vis face at the most convenient time the first time they meet a bit hard to suspend my disbelief there i could metaphorically see the physical th wall manifesting in the dialogue of the exchange usually the writers have been doing a better job of showing not telling",
        "i think what actually got vi around to tag along was cait almost dying vi cant handle that she feels like shes lost everyone else maddie felt more about vi realizing that the enforcers are not in fact all the same like she said in se and caitlyn is not the one single exception that proves the rule",
        "i think her appearance felt a little roughly shoehorned in but the actual content of the conversation makes sense she says that cait made a huge scene in the precinct and basically threatened to pull her familys money out of it which we have to understand would probably be a massive blow considering how everyone reacts to the kirramen name and stuff so she would be aware of caitlyn railing to get vi a place but theres no reason anyone would know vi refused since it appears to have been like half a day maybe since it happened and cait would have no reason to tell everyone \n\nso youve got this young idealistic recruit who is living in a place of fear and division and she sees this as a potential map of the future someone from zaun and someone from one of the biggest families in piltover are working so closely together that the latter was willing to throw away her distinguished career in order to give her a chance that shows that vi is someone to trust and if thats true for vi maybe it can be true for more people maybe theres still a way to fix this rift between the two halves of the city \n\nand being young and idealistic and seeing this person who she has built up in her head as a sort of idol well she cant help but gush about it and just lay it all out about how glad she is this is happening vis reaction to cait is very reasonable and makes sense it would have been worse to have her just roll over and accept the position right away and the fact that it takes her seeing someone looking up to her for her to understand that being an enforcer might actually be good an idea which is then further bolstered by the attack on the memorial it makes sense the only part thats really rough to my mind is the actual meeting itself which does feel a bit sharply out of place and deus ex machina",
        "i think it plays into the idea of maddie idolizing the enforcers she saw cait leaving with a badge for vi and never imagined someone would decline the position she is presented as a follower that does not have an understanding of the complexities of the zaunpiltover conflict",
        "ive seen that too but it wouldnt make sense as zhonyas hourglass only affects the player not anyone else",
        "yes exactly i saw someone saying something along the lines of the amount of suffering that vi has experienced did not make her into a dictator nor a senseless killer\ni know one could argue that jinx had a greater vulnerability regarding mental health and caits position of power made her prone to corruption but i think it the fact i think that vis suffering has been the greatest at that point only comes to show how vis honor and goodness shines strong through her pain like vander and cait saw she truly has a good heart",
        "i think op may be saying that the pacing is off in terms of how many cuts they are using in action sequences i agree with both of you though the writings pacing is off and the cinematography is a little too jarring so many sub second shots its hard to track it was present in s but i dont think it was this bad its funny that both animation and film use this technique but to hide different things i assume in arcanes case its just to save time and money",

        "its one of those shows thats so dense with running plot lines that it just feels essential imo like people going into episode  without remembering who sky was and why victor is hearing her voice wont get the significance and confused as hell understandable as she was only a rather minor character people likely forgot",

        "thanks",
        "yup got explained in later episodes",
        "sure did total",
        "i also think she believes if shes part of it she can guide them in the right direction and lead them away from placespeople she knows arent involved shes been away for awhile but she still knows the undercity better than any of them and shed love nothing better than targeting silcos goons and shimmer plants plus the jinx thing that may be the biggest part",
        "im aware of all these points and to me the switch to their side still doesnt make sense vi doesnt have most of the ppl in her life in large part because of the enforcerstheyre directly or indirectly responsible for most of their deaths\n\nif i situated this plot in the us it would be tantamount to a black person who was wrongly imprisoned for years by the police whose parents were killed by police  and whose community is simultaneously ignored and over surveilled by the police becoming a police officer it happens enough in real life but theres a whole reason behind why black folk become cops that has more to do with situating oneself closer to power the show clearly isnt going in that direction with vi so again her move doesnt make sense imo\n\ni dont think its realistic to root vis decision to join the enforcers in the protection of cait marcus being gone or in vi potentially having influence \n\n vi can followprotect cait in this battle without  joining the enforcers\n  marcus being gone doesnt explain it either he wasnt in charge of the enforcers when the enforcers killed vis parents he wasnt running the enforcers when we first meet him in season  and marcus was young in act  of season  so i doubt he was on the force at the time vis parents were killed therefore him being gone doesnt change anythingthey were oppressing the undercity before marcus got there and have continued to do so after his departure \n\nthe show depicts the enforcers as a systemic issue yes we see wellintentioned enforcers like maddie however the enforcers maintain the hierarchy of topside vs the undercity which in turn allows the subjugation of the undercity to proliferate therefore the enforcers are problematic on a systemic level it doesnt matter how many good apple enforcers there are and vi joining them doesnt change that\n\n i doubt vis influence would change the whole enforcers organization while i know this show is a cartoon arcane mimics real life well especially power dynamics the only exception is this specific storyline studies have shown that initiating change from within in police forces does not work the problematic culture is too ingrained for one individual to change \n\nvi is coming across to me as a sellout as opposed to a brave  supportive friendlover for me her love for cait doesnt cancel out the fact that shes forgone her ethics by joining the enforcers a key indicator of this is that shes joined a revenge mission to subdue her sister that includes battling members of the undercity with hexcore which will inevitably lead to the further subjugation of the undercity rather than a task force to stop corruption amongst enforcers or a task force to reduce violence in the undercity by the enforcers\n\ni think this another example of how amatonormativity leads to subpar character development",
        "did all of vis other siblings die in the first half of season  if not what happened to them",
        "exactly",
        "i dont see why people expect vi to have this undying loyalty to the lanes after all these years enforcers killed her first parents silco killed her second ekko is basically the last person in the under city from her old life and he runs one tiny gang the rest of it is run by chem barrons that worked for silco changing sides to piltover is the best option available",

        "can you refresh me plzz im having a hard time trying to understandremember cause its been so much time ive never played lol and im not with my lol player ex boyfriend anymore",
        "i think theyre talking about when she uses the key from her mother",
        "my point still stands why are you having your son work in such a dangerous place and getting mad when dangerous things happen a child has no business working in a drug mine anyway",
        "yes of course hes supposed to be something bigger than just a drunko they make it very obvious from the first glimpse hes giving while being laid down and then they do it again towards the end of the conversation just so its very very clear for the audience  also another reason i think its poorly written but anyway\nmy point is that theres absolutely no development towards making the audience see why hes worth it more than a scene where he shields someone with extreme strength i mean if a single attitude like that is enough to make you part of a special task force which btw couldve gone by unseen in the middle of a chaotic situation like that but sure lets say someone did see do you really think this is how people get institutions trust lol\nthis sounds like a show for kids now that i think about it and that makes a lot more sense and maybe this is why im a bit disappointed with the quality the st season wasnt for kids it was a very mature and full of depth story and i was probably expecting the same here",
        "i believe its because people are very passionate about the game and then by extension also about the show and this episode might have been full of fan service idk\n\nyou are right though dialogues do feel out of character vi was an awesome character to me in season  and i could feel her pain her motivation and her struggles she felt completely shallow and empty to me here\nif you analyze the episode purely from the scripting perspective it undeniably had problems imo but oh well",
        "this episode is the closest to a marvel movie that the show has ever felt and it has me worried for the rest of the season i cannot believe that vi became an enforcer in literally one episode she even says it these people killed her family they oppressed her for most of her life and yet we skip over what i feel like should be a seasonlong emotional journey just so that we can have a hero squad pose at the end\n\nthis doesnt even cover how the action sequences turned into a glorified champion showcase s excelled at introducing emotional weight to each fight each battle is a clash of ideals and relationships the two sides each have shades of gray and we hope that the conflict resolves outside of the fight since there are people we care about on both sides but now we have all the good guys ganging up on faceless robot monsters that are only good as fodder \n\nyes i know that s had one such fight but even that ended with the anticlimactic death of a civilian and was meant to show the consequences of the lets charge in with our new hextech strategy\n\noverall kind of stunned that theyre falling back on tv writing cliches to speed run through plot and character arcs im similarly hoping theyre saving room for something big but yeah i dont know what could be worth it either",
        "literally just finished ep yup still think ep  was the weakest probably of the whole series imo but the other  definitely made up for it",
        "hey so i dont know anything about league of legends outdside of arcane can you tell me what mels abilities are",
        "well a couple of things off the top of my head  it wouldve further justified jayce ignoring viktors request to destroy the hexcore as the thought of losing viktor on top of having just lost mel wouldve been too much for him it also wouldve given ambessa a huge reason to raid zaun as soon as possible even without the outside pressure of the black rose for that matter the story couldve simply ignored the black rose for this season and probably significantly reduced the rushed pacing that many people are complaining about",
        "two weeks ago netflix posted this watch video or skip to  confirmed thats mel",
        "are we watching the same show cause jayce brought it up but mel just shrug it the show wouldnt point that out if its just gonna hand waived it",
        "looked for additional sources based on your reply the initial one i read didnt clarify that  million was for both seasons combined\n\nim also filtering out the opening sequences reused x per season  end credits",
        "its much better than game of thrones and it really shows everything about this show is just so elite and deliciously crafted",
        "do you have a source for the perseason production budgets  of the overall budget is close to the marketing for traditional theatrical releases generally  to  of production cost whereas netflix usually spends a much lower",
        "especially because she was right between him and the window even jayce says that it is strange that he was fine but victor almost died being next to him",
        "most people theorize it has something to do with mels magic resp some golden clothing or metal jewelry she wears\n\n  \njust watched the ambessa song where she might be pregnant with mel and embryo mel did something similar there with ambessa so thats my current answer to that until the show shows us otherwise",
        "im writing this having only seen ep  but thats a really bizzare interpretation of the scene its very much him saying his survival doesnt make sense which further alludes to magic saving the both of them especially since they dont have a scratch",
        "its explicitly called attention to instory theres no way these things just happen i guess is the end of it",
        "honestly im not as confident about that its not like blatant plot armor is a rare occurance in tv shows hope youre right though",
        "i just googled of this is true holy shit\nyoure right im speechless",
        "i get the impression that keiramenn was caits mothers name and house and maybe her father just married into it agreed he doesnt really seem all that important and impactful to the governance of piltover more like a first gentleman kind of situation",
        "why does one preclude the other you can have advisors and still keep private files",
        "as someone that used to play league i was baffled how i dont recognise what champ or character from the lore he was because his face reveal was oddly built up",
        "lmao i thought this was gonna be fangirl cop",
        "oh thanks forgot her name",
        "i love that anime",
        "arcanes strength was always parallels glad to see them continuing it even with the music",
        "i agree i think this scene is very important for what it communicates but the presentation could have been done better i think everything  said is  on the dot with why maddie said what she said and the explanation behind her thinking this was also the introduction of the other two characters in caitlyns squad and im not sure why they havent been named yet but hey who am i \n\nso i think the concept of this scene was absolutely necessary but it does feel like it was a cheap shot at moving the plot along easily because of how the scene was executed",
        "yeah i see it but to be fair most stories need some kind of convenience to move things along and this was kinda mild",
        "had she initially accepted the role the other enforcers likely wouldnt have stopped her advance to protect mel they did let some rando enforcer walk up to the stage with a dufflebag so almost surely not i wonder if that played into her decision",
        "well also cause zhonyass is stasis and not a shield\n\ntheyre talking about locket of the iron solari which makes sense from a few different angles",
        "i mostly feel like theyre overdoing it with the music videos to skip multiple scenes \n\ni think the multiple cuts were also present in  but the cuts have been more disrupting like in vi vs jinx its gonna sound weird but it gave me the sensation of holding down to my seat because of how fast it was switching back and forth to jayce and how chaotic everything was and i can hardly remember a part of the choreography outside of things that id already seen in the trailer like vi ripping apart jinxs minigun",
        "yea its clear that some sacrifices were made to get this out faster increasing the team size only helps to an extent",
        "it is strange but realistic if you think about it the remaining council members have lost a few allies jayce has potentially lost his closest friend given the sheer amount of emotional and mental turmoil he experienced days leading up to the rocket he is mentally unstable af lmao and in no state to council",
        "makes sense",
        "i did google to make sure there wasnt a third season i like how the tight the narrative has been and closing the story when the story is over is always a good sign",
        "the episode goes out of the way to give you the reasons why the female enforcer in this episode basically spoonfeeds vi the info that cait looks up to her and vouched for her that marcus is seen as a traitor and doesnt represent the group as a whole and at the same time said shes glad vi will join as a good cop vi joins because changing the system from within is better than doing nothing or allowing the system to remain broken",
        "wait have you not watched season",
        "she is literally an enforcer in the game she was always going to be one in lore you people are hilarious",
        "also they have an invitation pretty obvious that ambessa manipulated salo to get the council use hex tech and going to war",
        "my tv does support dolby vision\nbut i downloaded it through a torrent maybe the file was badly encoded idk",
        "watch the last two episodes of season  its all there",
        "honestly i just rewatched the first season before starting this one",
        "they live in slums they cant afford to be picky if they want to survive",
        "fully disagree here went to episode discussion because season  is a while ago and to see some dots connected that i might have missed or forgotten adding tons of information dialogue etc would perhaps only lessen the impact of the previous season im not sure what youre looking for in a first episode of the season or how you would like your characters developed i cant imagine a show just telling you the name of a character and have all their accomplishments spelled out as an introduction hi this is naruto he has the seven tailed beast sealed into him the third hokage protects him due to naruto being the son of the fourth hokage the village treats him as shit because the villagers believe he is cursed welcome to the first episode of naruto \n\npacing wise  i do understand your wish for there to be more focus on all that happened in season  but i guess they needed to introduce some urgency it is a war decisions are made quickly there are plenty of oppurtunities left to showcase deeper conversations to explain connections and to trace back to how all this chaos could have happened",
        "this i feel the exact same way and good point in this episode sounding exactly like a marvel cliche movie just on point",
        "i cannot believe that vi became an enforcer in literally one episode she even says it these people killed her family they oppressed her for most of her life and yet we skip over what i feel like should be a seasonlong emotional journey just so that we can have a hero squad pose at the end\n\nright i think its kind of boring for vi to become an enforcer especially if theyre going to charge into the undercity it kind of undermines her very valid might i add trauma and character because it seems like she did it for caitlyn im hoping she doesnt turn into some lovesick idiot like jayce did for mel \n\ni really enjoyed her character in season one because she was so ambitious even if it was a little stupid and simpleminded her main objective was to make piltover pay for what they did and then she shifted her focus onto silco which is why she was even with the topsiders in the first place but now that hes dead what reason does she have to go against the undercity lets not forget that ekko is still there not to mention the small city he has tucked behind a wall im hoping they wont storm into the undercity and kill everyone especially people who are just trying to live",
        "good i came away from ep  thinking it was standout drop in fun from any s ep but happy if the next  are a return to form even reading though this thread all the praise its getting are for things i didnt think hit at all \n\ni thought caitlyn telling the rizzless silco to shutup was corny and the final shot of them assembling was too reminded me of the scene in the last avengers where all the girls posed together so they all came to strike a pose for the  leaders\n\nmost of the dialog was hammy or generic too like if i paused any scene and guess what they were going to say i would have been right each time tvplay talk that doesnt sound like how actual people speak hard to describe but we all know what it sounds like in different contexts",
        "mel isnt a playable character in league shes only in arcane",
        "neither do i lol im just theorizing there definitely has to be an explanation well just have to wait",
        "honestly that isnt such a bad price  million dollars for twelve hours of content isnt that uncommon for modern prestige tv and if you compare it to animated films you can definitely see the difference the most expensive animated film tangled cost about that much for only an hour and a half of footage the two spiderverse films which also garnered attention for amazing animation cost  million for a total of four hours of footage excluding credits roughly \n\ni worked it out and each frame in arcane costs about  dollars and honestly every single frame is a masterpiece",
        "same source as the m figure the variety article that made the rounds a few days ago \n\nthat has the m and m production budgets for s and s respectively called out separately the m is quoted as the s marketing budget the remaining m for their m estimate they dont go into same article claims netflix usinternational dist and tencent video china paid m each in licensing fees per episode",
        "after the council reunites where ambessa rolls out with salo it starts raining and the camera pulls up you can clearly see a very defined area where there was no damage done even no cracks\nseems to be heavily implying theres more to that than plot armor after the first season you probably should be giving them more credit than that",
        "the way the shield works in the runeterra card game ive never played league is that its more of a bubble than a barricade it has the same color gold glow as her armlets did in the end of season",
        "if it was plot armor the writers wouldnt call attention to it in the dialogue",
        "well i really hope he married into it otherwise he would need to be a brother uncle or cousin of his late wife",
        "from memory of season  this was confirmed already",
        "i dont think her name was mentioned more than maybe once",
        "i can definitely see that being the case the reality of knowing she could have done something if she had taken on the role in advance could definitely be a factor in what pushed her to take it on afterwards",
        "oh ik about it being stasis i just assumed they saw the same reddit post i did on it being zhonyas hourglass and the locket does kinda make sense but if they plan to make her a champion like they did ambessa maybe it could be a skill of hers or smth",
        "yeah you are right i dont know why its more of an annoyance for me now though i do recall some shots in s that were gorgeous but were so fast i had barely any time to take it in i hope rapid cutting goes away like shaky cam did but i think it just too useful for them to do away with it",
        "plus the only reason he seized a position of power on the council to begin with was to save viktor im sure hes feeling the weight of all the separate responsibilities and wants to step away from them",
        "also his act immediately before they got blown up was to convince the council to give the undercity complete amnesty and sovereignty for almost nothing in return with the attack hes surely lost their trust",
        "for real i cant think of any other shows that have had a definitive end after two seasons i always appreciate when writersshowrunners know when to end it instead of animating a corpse far beyond its expiry date",
        "my critique still stands the reasons the show gives doesnt justify the switch in my opinion especially because the show attempts to present vi as brave and loyal to her ppl \n\none thing i love about season  of arcane is its complex analysis of power dynamics and how power actually works too many studies have shown that changing an oppressive structure from within doesnt work \n\nthe reasons arcane gives for vis switch would make sense if they werent trying to paint her as a heroic figure of the undercity but since they are my critique still stands vi is a sellout and i hate that for her how is locking up your ppl and bringing fatal weapons to your already heavily oppressed home going to help your ppl\n\nalso i dont agree with your distilling vis options to either joining the enforcers or doing nothing we have several characters in the show from the undercity who do neither of the  eg echo so respectfully your point hasnt landed nor is it accurate\n\nalso whats a good cop",
        "not in the last  years i think i watched it twice though",

        "sure but she is wealthy mafia bosses dont need to send their children in mines they give them managerial positions",
        "its not about how i want my characters developed its about expecting characters and relationships to be developed just like they did in season  and no i dont want them to spell someones name and tell me all their accomplishments i want it to be shown to me throughout the story their moral values motivations importance  not necessarily in one episode again just like they did in season  with every key character and there were many no character was introduced quickly bonded and then became part of such an important arch like this at any point it was a far superior writing than this\ni agree its war and decisions have to be made fast that doesnt mean you have to chuck in  new chars just like that\nand i never said i wish there were more focus on all that happened in season  dont know where you got that from the pace problem for me is that they tried to achieve too much in one episode and it just felt rushed and shallow",
        "rizzless silco took me a sec but that is hilarious my man",
        "i didnt love how we started the new season basically moments after s ended it forced the show to basically dedicate the entire first episode toward tieing up loose ends from s and introducing the new plot lines in a rather boring and exposition dump way \n\nwouldve been nicer if we had a slight time skip and we the viewer could just see the aftermath and how its affecting our characters visually",
        "only thing weve got about mel mods dont get mad im assuming because netflix itself posted this too its something they wanted people to watch before the show is the music video about her mum nearly dying while pregnant with her was the same gold glow",
        "that number includes marketing which isnt usually counted in production budgets for other content so its even more worth it",
        "thanks didnt remember those details after reading the article earlier",
        "also just because something is convenient or hard to believe doesnt mean its plot armor\n\nwilder stuff happens in real life like people surviving a fall from a plane while thousands die slipping in the shower",

        "yeah and its been  years lol",

        "vi clearly does not have any intent of joining the enforcers before the attack\n\nin the beginning of the episode she clearly believes that stopping jinx can put an end to all the troubles but the attack demonstrates that the rot runs deeper\n\nif vi views the undercity or the actions of the undercity in attempting to claim more power from topside as rot that further supports my point that vi is sellout i mean she comes from that area and at one point wanted to fight back against topside so if she went from that to someone who sees undercity and their struggles as rot thats sad\n\nthe reason a figure like silco could rise up in the undercity isnt just because hes a powerful strongman its also because the sentiments allowed for a power figure like him to exist his death does not change that\n\nnot sure what youre getting at here or how it relates to my argument that i think its corny that vi became an enforcer can you elaborate on this point\n\ni dont think vi is really smart enough to realise this but she can reach the conclusion that jinx isnt the only problem in the undercity\n\nsee my response directly above\n\n\nand to follow this up with your own point too many studies have shown that changing an oppressive structure from within doesnt work well same goes for vi doesnt it then  \n\n\nyouve misquoted me here the well same goes for vi doesnt it then appear to\u00a0be your words and yes the same goes for vi awesome we agree on this vi cannot change the enforcers from within so her decision to join is making less to me at least  i mentioned the studies in response to another reddit user who argued that vi could change the enforcers from within \n\nand why do you assume that vi joining the enforcers only has to do with caitlyn\n\ni dont believe that vi joining the enforcers only has to do with caitlyn but the show used her connection with caitlyn as the primary motivator behind her decision we can gauge this bc when vi spoke w the young enforcers and maddie mentioned that caitlyn made a scene when the enforcers tried to deny her enlistment vi literally almost choked on her drink vi was disinterested with their words up until they mentioned caitlyn \n\nalso after the memorial we see caitlyn upset as she tries to figure out how to best apprehend jinx and the undercity she mentions that everything is falling apart and vi says  we wont let it the next time we see vi shes in an enforcers uniform this indicates that vi became an enforcer primarily to support caitlyn \n\nmore importantly vis whole deliberation and choice to join the enforcers is framed in reference to her relationship with caitlyn when she initially rejects caitlyns offer they had a rift in their relationship and it was visibly tense between the two but once she chose to join they instantly became closer to me this and the other points mentioned above indicate that the relationship with cailtyn is a major motivator behind vis decision\n\nalso to note i dont recall scenes from that episode showing vi contemplating that her choice would further put her at odds with her sister and the city in which she grew up instead the focus was primarily on her dynamic with caitlyn this is what im talking about when i say a focus on amatonormativity leads to poor writing  youre about to join forces with the institution that killed your parents and fight against your younger sister in a battle that might kill her and your focus is mainly on your crush like what there were more interesting plot routes to take\n\nwhy do you think shes happy to be a part of the enforcers what makes you think that in her mind she wouldnt leave once the undercity problem is solved\n\ni mean shed still be a sellout imo if she left once the undercity problem was solved shes joining forces with the enforcers to further oppress her people bringing hexcore weapons into the undercity isnt going to\u00a0 do anything but facilite the further subjugation of its ppl vi being a temporary enforcer doesnt change that\n\ntheres no one catalyst to vi joining the enforcers its influenced by many things and in the moment she sees it as her best option\n\nagreed but the show uses vis relationship with caitlyn as a main one and i think it wouldve been more interesting if she didnt join enforcers but still tried to stop her sister from killing more ppl\n\n\nwith so many factors at play not to even mention the backstory that you keep bringing up literally anything she does make sense from her subjective point of view even if you think youre objectively right about what she should do if such objectivity could be achieved to begin with\n\ni dont think im objectively right not sure where you got that from my point is an opinion it can never be anything but subjective  i do know what a character could do to make them more interesting to me which is in line with my original point  using romantic love as the main motivator here made vi less interesting\n\nand imo vi isnt portrayed as a champion of the people or anything shes respected to have heart and courage and to stand for what she thinks is right people are fond of her for being vanders daughter but id say they know shes a loose canon i dont know where you even got the idea of vi being peoples champion she was young when she was jailed she literally didnt have any time to do anything for the people\n\nyoure misquoting me i said the show attempts to present vi as brave and loyal to her ppl and that the show is trying to paint her as a heroic figure of the undercity thats different than me saying shes a ppls champion \n\nwe see the show attempt to do these things especially in the beginning of season  her tension with vander was in part due to her frustration around him cooperating w the enforcers and him not fighting for the ppl of the undercity in a more direct way i would absolutely say that the writers were attempting to frame her as a person who is brave  loyal to her ppl and a future heroic figure for the undercity",

        "after reading through all of this i wanted to add my two cents\n\ni dont think their relationship is romantic in the slightest at least currently jayce verbatim said that viktor is like a brother to him however dont forget that the first  years of their partnership is off screen we only see a tiny fragment of their relationship so whatever the writers chose to write is going to be meaningful and carefully crafted so their relationship absolutely goes deeper than just friends but in a more familial way or like a platonic soulmate\n\ni do believe they may have had a romantic aspect to their relationship during that  year time skip though viktors immediate reaction to mel catching him and jayce breaking into heimerdingers lab being  wait a minute this isnt my bedroom was way too quick of a reaction to not be rooted in some romantic or sexual attraction at least in my opinion viktor is extremely intelligent so maybe he was just able to pull something out of his ass on the spot i think this is totally based on opinion though and its an aspect of the show that creators left to be interpreted they couldnt show the main plot or any side plots of the time skip they could only show the start and end point its up to us to fantasize about what could have transpired so long as they end in the same spot\n\nbut i do think that their current relationship is canonically not romantic that doesnt mean that its not intimate or deep or meaningful they have probably seen more of each other as partners for almost a decade than anyone else has ever seen of them physically and metaphorically experiencing life together like this will ultimately create an intense emotional and meaningful bond but that doesnt mean its romantic they just genuinely care for each other and love each other\n\ni want to clarify that i have nothing against the ship because i just love exploring their dynamic but its definitely a non canon ship",

        "funny how people always make these comments when people are talking about potential queer ships friendships can be intimate but if you compare viktor to mel and ask me which one i would consider to be jayce his soulmate i would say viktor they have saved eachothers life multiple times hextech became both their dreams and they spend years together building and studying that they are clearly very close and jayce is pretty touchy with viktor and the way how viktor is seen reacting to it is pretty interesting lol also has  characters and most of the queer characters are female so when you consider this all together i dont think its so bizarre for people to wonder if this could be something more then friendship",

        "guys probably havent had the right guy friendships if they think this is weird",
        "it is more than friendship jace considers victor his brother he has said this before they are as close as family everything you said makes sense when viewed under that light\n\nalso soulmates can be platonic too but thats a whole different discussion",
        "id get it if he wasnt already in a relationship with mel definitely a platonic soulmatesbrotherly love sort of relationship",
        "because any time men fictional or not are intimate with each other people accuse them of being gay as if intimacy is incongruous with the nature of men and is only accessible to them with homosexuality\n\nalso like what would it add to the story if they felt romantic about each other it would mean that jayce is settling by being with mel because he doesnt want to be with viktor for some reason it would make the scene where jayce says he considers viktor his brother awkward it would mean that viktor wasnt ignoring that girl because he was too focused on his work but because he was gay is it really worth it just to be able to say that lol has  more queer character whos male",
        "the point theyre getting at is that the creators chose to make the scene ambiguous\n\nwhats ambiguous about the scene jace has many times conveyed how he views victor as his brother and nothing in this scene really contradicts that notion unless you want to force a romantic interpretation in there jace literally already has someone he is in love with and in a relationship with its not really a matter of if you want it to be platonic it just is like its not a both sides are right type of situation lol",
        "maybe it was but he ran away before they saw him",

        "that might be true",
        "but will they rework him though then like his base skin doesnt make sense compared to arcane atm just a robotic dude no any resemblance of the hexcore",

        "yeah caitlyns target are chembrothers too anybody working with silco",
        "lol",
        "ok this clears it up my only issue is that the initial scene really seemed to imply that the accountant was killed or at least taken its weird to see him again later and also not see schmeetzs reaction to the whole monster in the grey thing",
        "yup that one the one whos son died",
        "they flat out explain and have an entire stylized sequence of the team going through the kirammen airflow tunnels lol",
        "yea i was thrown off by that thinking it was some type of monster earlier it showed singed going to the wolf cave thing so i thought it was that",
        "nahh i know nothing about the lore  but i heard they are changing some stuff so maaaybe",
        "sure but how many people do you see actually being invested in jayce and mel and could you even say that jayce and mel have a goodinteresting relationship i look at caitvi very differently then jaycemel and i think a majority does i like mel as a character but i am really curious if she and jayce are really meant to be together\n\nhe even says it himself that his place was always in the lab with viktor not in the council that he mostly got into because of mel\n\nalso im not sure their relationship is romantic just mostly that its not shocking that people think it could be romantic and that honestly his and viktors relationship is more dynamic then his with mels",
        "being gay is not something you can accuse of",
        "dont forget viktor also had his girl \n\nbut more importantly viktors whole character is that of a man obsessed with improving lives and how little time he has left to do so the guy is married to his work and goal in life whether hes gay pansexual hetero or whatever makes no difference whatsoever because hes not interested in anything but his goal in life\n\ni also honestly dont see how jayce and him are supposedly soulmates just because they have the same passion in life are ronaldo and messi soul mates and secretly gay too lol",
        "whats not ambiguous about the scene jace and viktor have always had an intimate relationship and that can easily be interpreted as underlying romantic unless youre trying to force a heterosexual interpretation in there jayce being in a romantic relationship with mel wouldnt prevent the possibility of him andor viktor having romantic vibes for the other its not really a matter of if you want it to be ambiguous it just is like its obviously a both sides can be right type of situation lol",
        "his rework will come out soon",
        "i still dont get how we know who the monster was im pretty convinced that it wasnt explained",
        "at jayces hands by accident if i remember correctly",

        "i wont take your hope from you",
        "theyre changing lore you have a source for this i dont play lol so im out of the loop",
        "cute\n\nfunny thing is i dont even deny the possibility of victor himself maybe having had feelings for jacebefore becoming metal jesus against his willbut jace himself has always made it clear in both his actions and his words that this was a platonic relationship to him trying to use my words against me is cute like i said but it doesnt really reflect the reality of what was shown and said in the show",
        "i just finished episode  and am  certain the monster is cait and her team the gas we see the accountant going through with all the downed bdsm gang members is the same used against jinx and when vi moves into the gas the camera distorts for a moment to make her look like the monster the accountant saw this is also added that the chem baron only suggests going after jinx after his accountant has a run in with the gas monster and we see him and his goons nabbing jinx after she barely escapes caits team im assuming cait and her team interrogated the one chem baron and he agreed to help nab jinx and recruit other barons to do the same jinxs hideout is an old hangout for vi as well so naturally they investigated there and the baron probably followed so he could nab jinx and claim the bounty",
        "yeah collateral damage as he was helping silcos chemsquad when fighting them with vi",
        "whoops i just binged the two acts were people really watching an episode then coming to discuss the acts dropped all the episodes at once\n\nregardless its literally explained in the next episode so",
        "bro literally spoiling it lol",
        "thats your interpretation youre entitled to it as are the people who interpret both jayce and viktors actions as having romantic undertones it seems odd to me that youre arguing as if there is a canonical answer to the question when there isnt",

        "one thing i appreciate about the ending is that the music is entirely orchestrated \n\nim loving the needle drops in the show but the composers need moments to shine too it was nice to have a dramatic moment without some lyrical overlay just a good well composed track that fit the tone of the scene very well and damn was it good",
        "am i the only one who thinks jinx is talking about herself when she said she wanted to kill the rest of her family she seemed so content on vi killing her at the end",
        "in the part where caitlyn was about to shoot jinx and isha was on top of her i feel like vi kinda used isha as an excuse so caitlyn wouldnt shoot jinx",

        "this season has glaring placid issues this episode has at least  minutes worth of plot squished into  i wish they made arcane into a three season show because its becoming more and more obvious that the plot lines and ideas are too many for the current structure of the show",
        "so we see ambessa right hand guy hand a black letter to one of the chemlord vengeance for your son  \nin episode  i believe we see caitlyn with a big stack of opened letters and then extra emohasis on her opening a same looking black letter presumable from ambessa then  \nwe never hear whats said inside the letter though probably just the normal condolences etc but the specific emphasis on the letter kinda wanted me for it to be something more",
        "man that v with the wild rune shenanigans was aamazing",
        "that entire end sequence with caitlyn and ambessa was \n\namazing act  so far",
        "i dont know much lol lore but i do have a request\n\njanna do something for your people",

        "cant believe jayce got the diavolo treatment",
        "gotta say while the season has been going by fast with the pacing its been solid so far in particular i think its done a decent job of really selling the idea of a cycle of violence consuming groups of people and spiraling out of control with how things have played out a lot of works tend to just lay out one or two inciting incidents and play it out but arcane really used season one to build up the piltoverzaum tension to show how it got to a boil and how one chaotic element can push it over the edge and compound especially when its actually the decision makers who have an emotional stake in their choices excited to see where this goes\n\n  \ni also gotta make a gif of the various people chest thumping in salute i think that would make a funny reaction gif",
        "the d animation for the gasses are really fucking good and cool",
        "when cait hit vis before leaving i went full really  vi took way more than that in the gut without being hurt what it this \n\nand my wife immediately answered thats not her gut that was hurt in this scene\n\ni was aware of it but coming from my wife who didnt even watch season  and usually doesnt care that much about stuff that was powerful",

        "removed",
        "alright i think i looked through them all and didnt see it discussed in the intro cinematic where the enforcer strike team is moving through the pipes and searching for jinx i noticed they have a bit where caitlin shoots her rifle it makes a cross hair in the screen and then flashes the two remaining chem barons that jinx and sevika didnt fight sorry i dont know their names \n\nis that to imply that oneboth of them were killed by the strike team it seems that way but that feels rather unceremonious compared to the one in s e thoughts",
        "personally i think that sevika has taken on a bit of a role as a new big sister for jinx where silco has taken on a role as a replacement father so vander for jink sevika replaces vi\n\n\n\nand isha the little girl seems to be like a little sister to her hoping that it really goes in this direction in the next episodes",

        "does anyone feel as though the series is leading to jinx killing caitlin both tragic villains in the end ive been getting a wilson wilson feel from the latter this season",
        "when she was growing up vi was the leader when caitlyn broke her out of stillwater vi led caitlyn around the undercity and that grew into them being a team equals a partnership\n\nwith the special force team and caitlyn being command i dont think vi is comfortable with taking orders from her even when she lovesrespects caitlyn vi isnt her follower \n\nwhile vi maybe likes that her girlfriend is from a wealthy upbringing and has affluence to create positive change in their cities vi knows better than to place moral value on social status what caitlyn is to vi is much more than a kiramman how vi values people is much deeper and more personal than societal constructs\n\nvis original suggestion was to go alone after jinx that is what vi is comfortable with\n\nvi is more comfortable calling the shots going at it by herself or sharing in the decisionmaking with someone she has respect for following caitlyns orders as just one of the team was likely degrading for her she likely felt demoted from her position of importance in caitlyns eyes being part of a group that had the dynamic of being at vis level in relation to caitlyn so she did what she could to regain being level with caitlyn\n\nin regaining her personal power in the situation she really does seem to want to respect caits values and dignity too she doesnt want to undermine caitlyn and disrespect her authority in front of the others in addition to respecting her she loves her so she asks for time to speak with who she see as her partner one on one \n\nshe asks caitlyn to cut the other enforcers loose so that it can be just the two of them making it a scenario where if she isnt obeying caitlyns orders she isnt disrespecting caitlyns position as leader of the enforcers plus this is how they got to know each other and its how vi likes to work with caitlyn she isnt wanting it to change between them\n\nvi asking caitlyn to not change could be about how shes now experiencing caitlyn as her boss essentially prior to that it was the two of them against the world they were building a partnership obviously too caits grief is clearly making her hateful and making vi fearful of a personality shift\n\nvi doesnt want a boss she wants a partner who at times listens to her and follows her lead she needs to be valued for who she is and in her own right that is a leader also vis leadership isnt a birthright or a job title its her personality and who she is vi needs caitlyn to share leadership with her \n\nonce the rest of the team left and caitlyn and vi were on their own thats what happened vi made choices thatif the team had still been therewhat happened wouldve been disrespectful to caitlyns job as the commander of the task it was disrespectful in caitlyns view but there werent enforcers there to witness it\n\nthe power dynamics between caitlyn and vi has to be balanced both in working together and romantically or it doesnt work caitlyn just has more power in general so for them to have balance caitlyn has to give vi the freedom to be empowered take care to listen to vi and choose to put things vi suggests into action which is what shes been doing overall caitlyn has been really great and understanding with vi and learning who vi is\n\nvi making requests in private is her way of giving respect to caitlyn while also reclaiming her own both self respect and communicating the respect she needs as a partner\n\nnow after that mess of a mission when caitlyn allowed vi to do it her way vis choices arent getting caitlyn her desired results so caitlyn has lost respect and is seeing her affection towards vi as a problem vis decisions are conflicting with what caitlyn ultimately wants in life when previously she saw vi as an asset for everything she is hoping to achieve with vi caitlyn wouldve had it all a coworker lover adviser friend and even now someone to relate to about the trauma of losing a parent but immediately following the failed mission its not looking like caitlyn will get what she thinks she needs out of her connection with vi \n\nvi realized maybe that she doesnt want jinx to die\n\nthe relationship between vi and caitlyn is the epitome of its complicated\n\ncaitlyn walking away from vi is maybe teaching vi how caitlyn felt all the times she walked away from her this time its a real breakup when the one who is typically walked away from is the one leaving you can never walk away from someone multiple times and expect them to always be there for you vis behavior in the development of their relationship set her up for heartache she certainly has selfdestructive behavioral patterns though i dont blame her\n\nbecause caitlyn gets vi and has been very understanding she must really have known how hitting vi with the backend of her rifle would hit vi not only in her gut but her heart as well she really did think about it before she did it coldhearted ouch \n\nanother thing to note is that while we dont know caitlyns full story we do know shes been sheltered and can assume she hasnt experienced muchany trauma beyond what she saw as a hunter murdering animals and an enforcer vi has become accustomed to trauma her entire upbringing just being poor is traumatic\n\nvi has been through so much losing cupcakeafter everything and after caitlyn being her hopewould send anyone over the edge \n\nvis heart is precious which is why she developed such a rough exterior caitlyn knows this and she just left her there to feel unlovable useless and abandoned caitlyn is my favorite character but she really did vi dirty here after completely shifting the trajectory of vis life to leave her there shes deep in her own pain though\n\nim so sad for vi losing cait has to hurt but losing her like this and at this point is devastating they absolutely could have been good for each other in this time of caitlyns grief and the social collapse of piltover and zaun but maybe apart is better idk \n\ni mainly wanted to point out that vi is definitely not a follower she has a sigma personality and its unnatural for her to be bossed by anyone",
        "theres so many things happening so quickly that im having trouble understanding some of the new concepts like the gray and wild runes but my main question is this how does the leader of a foreign country visiting the city essentially appoint a dictator without any council vote that whole process seemed super informal she just made a speech handed caitlyn a snazzy jacket and everyone seemingly went along with it is there something about the politics of the world i dont understand",
        "heavily interested in the implications of whatever was going on with the hex tech surely jayce may switch teams obviously being aware of the glitch how did none of them jinx and vi fight scene get concerned when their hex tech was jumping in the th dimension maybe u could say they were in survival mode but when it hurt vi should have been where jinx started to get the upper hand would make more sense then her being on parr with vi from the start of their physical fight",
        "no one gonna mention that sevika smirked at cait biting her like shes obviously into that lmao",
        "too many characters too many plot points not enough time im loving it so far it makes me feel horrible about myself for days after i watch it it reminds me of hurtful things people have done to me and of how little justice there is in the world its really good and i love it it makes me feel things thats good\n\n but im also sad they had to cram everything into  seasons pacing is an issue i bet the writers did their best though it has so much potential i dont reckon introducing so many characters all at once and not being able to properly develop them thoroughly makes for a good character based show i hope they somehow manage to i love this show",
        "ambessas fit was fire but has anyone talked about how ambessas braided hairstyle looks like a black rose maybe its just her insane style going hard or something more",
        "the show is so visually great and i do enjoy it but i think fanboys being fanboys call it a \n\nits a lot of buildup and i get it but so much plot armor and bouncing around haha\n\nvisually a  the rest eh ish",
        "ohhh i was so sure they were about to gas those above alas paint",
        "one little music thing i havent seen anyone mention yet is that to ashes and blood echoes a bit of guns for hire in addition to being by the same artist  of guns for hire and  of to ashes and blood",
        "am the only one kinda sad vi so easily is ok with killing jinx after the whole ive never abandon you speech it kinda just hurts i expected her to trycare more but when i  think about it logically i know im wrong",
        "i just finished the episode vi needs a happy ending or im not going to do okay",
        "singed im mad scientist its so coooool",

        "i know the \u00a0story reason will be \u00a0the plot needs jinx alive\n\nbut why didnt vi just pick up the child and move her off jinx \u00a0 the child is like  years old no way vi the boxer with magic gauntlets could just move her to let caityln gun jinx down\n\nwhyd jinx bring the  year old with her in the first bloody place  \u00a0ignore the probability of a  year old keeping up with them and not crying to take a break as the traverse the deepest part of the sewers in the entire city\n\ni am not a fan of the  give the villain a kid so they are more sympathetic trope i just hate it obvious emotional manipulation to distract from bad behavior\n\ni do look forward to are fearless leader cait",
        "am i crazy or did so much stuff happened this episode that i completely lost track of wth went down i have no idea what i just watched feels like im missing so much context which is a first because this show has always been easy to follow",
        "man season  arc  completely blows season  arc  out of the water these first three episodes are all so fantastic i need someone to fucking geek over it with it checks every single fucking mark and went way above expectation i cant man i need someone who gets these feelings that are going inside me",
        "i will say my only gripe is how toe to toe jinx was with vi in close quarters it shouldve been over in a second once they got to fist fighting range gauntlets or not it looked like vi was struggling lmao",
        "oh no besbian lreakup",
        "did the colour explostion jinx made have any kind of effect in the end like it hit the whole city but was it just colourful smoke or was it the grey like what was the point of that i feel like we didnt get to see its effect really\n\ni feel like the plot just rushes so fast i cant keep up with everything emotionally and with the politics feels kind of forced to me sadly  \ni loved season one because they took their time with individual scenes and characters i feel like they lost that weight by making everything so fast",
        "im rewatching this episode  and i have to ask what the black rose meant when they said what youve stolen is more precious than any gold they cant mean hextech because she hasnt taken anything officially to noxus \n\nblack rose says did you really believe you were beyond our reach\nambessa says my son is dead is that not enough to sate your bloodlust \nblack rose i havent insulted your intelligence ambessa dont insult mine we know that youre chasing in piltover we will not allow it\nambessa says allow thank you your visit only confirms my suspensions try to stop me insolent witch\nblack rose my death means nothing you should have given up the feud\nambessa you have no inkling what family is to me\n\nok  so my guess is this entire convo is about mel she got pregnant with mel and took mel from them they were fine with it when she sent mel to piltover because they got to watch over her from a distance what feud is being implied here her feud with the black rose or another past feud \n\ntheir visit would have confirmed her own suspicions about her daughter being a mage \nthis conversation seems so important i know im missing pieces",
        "how did sevika lose that fight against cait she practically beat vi in the bar scene from s and wtf was that opening move ambush a sniper by stepping in front\n\nother nitpick how did caits gunfired bullets not pierce the big shimmer mutants helmet but some human thrown spears did\n\nlastly anyone else find the jinx vs vi fight edited way too fast",
        "the guy vi picked up from the streets  big burly dude the one that left when cait became the martial law leader  i either missed something or in the first  episodes the show did not make clear who this person is and how or why he joined the enforcers\n\nfor context i am not familiar to lol lore at all so if hes supposed to be recognized from that i wouldnt",
        "im so glad i rewatched s before starting s caits descent into tyranny hits so much harder when you remember that the first thing she did after coming back from the undercity was to challenge her moms views about the people of zaun its such a realistic portrayal of grief and its power to blind you\n\nalso the sound of vis whimpers when cait hit her killed me you could have ripped out my heart and it would have hurt less\n\njinx saying im glad its you had to be you when vi had her pinned down made me want to scream and bawl my eyes out like a baby and i would have if isha hadnt interrupted and ultimately saved her life\n\nwhat in the world is going on at the hextech gates the scenes where ekko heimerdinger and jayce were multiplying had me thinking about the spiderverse arcaneverse is thats whats happening down there please dont answer i dont want to be spoiled\n\nall in all this was such a beautiful way to end s act  i cant wait to dive into act  tomorrow",
        "do yall think cait and vi could ever get back together",
        "the comicstyle intro animation was one of the most badass things ever a true banger",

        "i think i found a plothole  when jinx and vi are fighting each other anything with a hex orb whatever those blue round things are ill just christen them hex orb for now like vis gauntlets malfunction but why then is jinx still able to fire her gun it also has a hex orb so shouldnt it have malfunctioned at the same time",

        "am i the only one annoyed at that little kid seems they only introduced her for convenience she isnt really needed because we know vi will always hesitate to kill jinx",
        "man i feel so bad for vi not only is her sister super far gone but now her girlfriend is going down a path vi cant save her from either its crazy out here",
        "some questions i had\n\n how come ambessa has been allowed this much power in piltover she is dictating things at this point\n\n what was the point of the underground hexbase place where they discover a wild rune do we know what implications it will have\n\n what is jinx plan at this point to lure vi into the tunnels and take her on she was lucky it was only  enforcers otherwise she was cooked much earlier her accepting death so easily was a bit tragic tho\n\n what did jinx mean when sevika opened the grey into piltover that it was not supposed to be like this what were jinxs intentions",
        "ambessa appointing caitlyn as general with a long speech while everyone just sits and listens reminded me so much of tyrion and his who better than bran the broken got spoiler speech",
        "is the show implying that ambessa is setting up caitlyn to failure so that she can takeover piltovers forces considering she is after hextech all along or is she genuinely choosing caitlyn because the show impliedthrough salo that she is the best candidate ro lead because her family name commands respect actually never mind writing it out kind of made it obvious\n\n\nalso i dont get what is so wrong with caitlyns actions granted she and the rest of the piltover are getting played by ambessa but from her pov they are getting pulverized by jinx and the chembarons half of their council is dead and then they get attacked during the memorial for those deceased councilors that last color thing by jinx is just straightup insult considering it doesnt even seem to do any damageor maybe the gas is bad considering that little kid who gets caressed by ambessa duiring her monologue is wearing a mask and has red eyes\n\ni see the irony in caitlyn using the same masks her mother envisioned as a protection for people getting affected by the grey to enforce her vengeance but she hasnt hurt an innocent soul until now and only arrested the criminals so i dont see why the show is implying that she is as bad as jinx who is a complete psychopath terrorist like what is she supposed to do and why did that wannabe wander guy walk away from her anointing considering he just participated along with her in her mission is he the only one realizing ambessa is manipulating them or does he think that waging a full scale war is too harsh for his taste",
        "when vi and caitlin split from the other  enforcers loris the guy with the shield is limping  do they explain why  i watched it twice to see if i missed anything but is that cut content",

        "she was originally a guest of piltover a decorated general from arguably the most powerful nation noxus so she already had a significant influence when she arrived but shes not exactly the commanding power in piltover at least to the citizens view which is why she is manipulating salo as a puppet council member \n\n it was the core of the hexgates that they built above ground they built it way underground as a safety measure for the people of piltover in the event that it goes haywire like building a power plant away from the residential area they literally just found out that overuse of the arcane is finally having repercussions and ekkos home is experiencing its consequences because the tunnel systems eventually connect to zaun\n\n seems like she was expecting to be killed by vi but have one last big show by blasting the grey into piltover with her own flair \n\n this supports the idea that jinxs planned to go out with a big bang one last farewell bomb aboveground",
        "theres a huge crisis in piltover right now the citizens are getting killed and they basically just had a  at their council chamber lol so the foreign aid is being welcomed and ambessa is playing on that to seize power\n there are likely lots of implications but the most obvious to me is heimerdinger and jayce and ekko studying it to build ekkos time machine that hes iconic for",
        "as far as jinxs plan i dont think she has one beyond getting back at vi her whole life shes been ordered around by vi vander silco and now shes finally alone and kind of aimless she knows that shes angry at vi so she wants to do something about that but i really dont think shes thought of anything else thats probably why when vi was about to kill her she looked so relieved she thought she may be able to get her revenge and not have to deal with living afterwards",
        "jinx probably wanted vi to kill herself tbh so when the kid and ambessa stopped it she said it wasnt supposed to go like this",
        "actually she willingly hurt many many people underground by taking advantage of the ventilation system her mother created to release the grey to their advantage thats why the entire strike team has been wearing gas masks and storming into clouds of smoke wherever they go looks like caits mother connected the entirety of the underground with her system and ironically that same system is also what blasted the grey back up to topside\n\nthey rushed through that with the little bit they showed in the beginning of the episode wish they actually animated some of that at least and for how hyped up the chembarons were every member got trashed almost immediately",
        "i thought were not supposed to share lore spoilers in here \n\nall discussion of lore spoilers can be removed without warning even if they have been hidden with spoiler syntax",
        "apparently its a chant in a language thats part of the universe i dont remember the name tho so you can just search the song to ashes and blood",
        "didnt season  do that a lot too",
        "agreed its too teen angsty for me",
        "i like this season unlike a lot of you but this part bugged me vi got on jace for being mad he killed one child because she knew it would save so many more lives then to turn around and stop caitlyn from taking the shot it made zero sense for her character",
        "it was cait squad their masks and walking formation made it look like a beast amidst the smoke\u00a0\n\n\nwe later saw via jinx what was really inside",
        "its because in s heimerdinger wasnt thinking scientifically anymore he was more of a political figure but once he arrives in zaun and meets ekko he invents up inventing again the spinning top the bubble machine and rekindles his scientific passion for discovery",
        "they mixed the gray from the undercity with colored smoke for effect you can see it affecting some of the citizens with their irritated eyes",
        "the viktor thing bothers me heimerdinger looks at the ungodly horror of viktors reincarnation vessel and in absolute horror he asks wheres viktor the scene ends\n\n\nand then the next time we see heimerdinger hes clambering up a stool and playing with a monkey wrench",
        "i interpreted it as heimerdinger being scarred by the previous magic wars but has now seen the good it can do in hextech he also now has to fix an existing problem and not play politics to prevent one i also think the discovery of echo and the tree society affected him a lot",
        "kind of weak i dont like how vis says one thing like shes ready to kill and then switches over she had the chance to kill her too but hesitated before the kid intervened\n\nits too convenient and one of the things i enjoyed about this series was they didnt make things convenient just for the sake of it jinx should have been dead by now i rather the show just lets jinx escape on her own doing without these vulnerable opportunities rather than having circumstances like this as the reason why she got away again",
        "i really hate how the kid was used as a plot device to stop them from killing jinx i think we all knew that jinx wasnt going to die in this fight but throwing in some random kid who was just introduced as the deus ex machina to save jinx feels like pretty lazy writing i really hated that part of the episode",
        "you mean the theme song enemy  i disagree lol\n\ni adore this orchestral version and the visuals  like the aftermath of grief",
        "i dont much care for the sound track at all in general  though i have been known to hate on imagine dragons from time to time so thats to be expected",
        "i love it",
        "hes pressing down on its production in zaun and endorsed caitlyns kill squad to dismantle it but is also using it in private and not in meager quantities its a public scandal to expose him as someone not recommendable for position of commander",
        "its great actually skill issue i say",
        "that kid watched jinx kill like  guys point blank lol i think theyd get over it",
        "i believe that was the point that neither side are good guys and the purpose of this arc was to hammer that down  like jayce killing the child last season regretting it where here cait almost does and doesnt regret it  entirely different viewpoints on similar situations it does seem that cait may be going down the tragic villain route",
        "shes not thinking straight due to her immense grief and anger i believe she was closer to her mother than her father grief and anger can blind you sometimes",
        "i believe cait is in the mindset right now to do a lot of nasty things",
        "caits take on zaunite children at this point is gas the animals she believes in collective punishment why would the emotional wellbeing of a zaunite child concern her she wants them to suffer emotionally and physically",
        "cops are never good guys their function is not to be a good guy",
        "that was singed the doctor and the frankestein hanging no clue",
        "i mean the one thing jayce has never been shy about is messing with magic him and victor have done a bunch of risky shit messing with hextech without considering the repercussions especially early on in the show",
        "ambessa killed her even though she was the one that spurred her into doing the attack during the memorial ambessa is trying to destabilize piltover and make them start a war with zaun so that hex tech further advances then shell be able to fight the person or thing hunting her down",
        "i think it was meant to show that it was ambessa who let those downsiders and then it was she herself who saved the councillors too basically it was a all a big set up to give her a bigger advantage to control the council i think im really worried what this will mean for caitlyn",
        "so far i preferred the fight scenes in s as well\n\nthe ekko vs jynx stylized fight worked very well there but it would be cool to get some more normal fights in s\n\nreally digging the show so far though",
        "i agree i was thinking the fight between jinx and vi would be more hitting if it was silent and we just heard the struggle between them because there was so much tension",
        "there was so much going on im still a bit confused what jayce was doing in his arc and how that affected what was happening in the battle the hextech weapons were kind of going wild but was that just the audiences perspective or did the characters in the fight not notice their weapons were spazzing out",
        "removed",
        "thats literally what the show tells you it is lol its just colored because jinx added her flair",
        "ambessa arranged the assassination attempt as a false flag operation so that she could step in to stop it since she knew her daughter wouldnt push for war the tube lady in question having been the mother of the young boy jayce killed last season",
        "ambessa had rictus her main henchman hand the black envelope to renni tube lady probably a condolence letter for rennis son the boy that jayce killed as a way to emotionally manipulate her to convince her to get vengeance by attacking likely doing whatever rictus may have suggested i assume rictus and renni spoke after he handed her the envelope \n\nrenni saying its you to ambessa when she kills her makes me think that the two actually spoke that or renni just knew who ambessa was and put two and two together either way renni didnt know about ambessanoxus fighting on piltovers side and that the deal that rictus made with renni or ambessa with renni was just a set up",
        "i am not going crazy",
        "in ep  they mention that the zaunites who attacked the memorial had help from the topside and at the very least had an invitation\n\nits revealed that ambessa planned that to keep the fires of conflict stoked and to prevent the argument that it was a lone gunman jinx but that instead its all of zaun",
        "i dont think viktor can exorcise whats wrong with jinx but man that could make for a funny moment so much senseless pain followed by big boom of light followed by jinx being exactly the same",
        "i think jinx crossed point of no return when she launched that attack on the senators shes got blood on her hands na not just the bad people i dont see her getting a fairytale happy ending maybe redemption in some form she must face justice",
        "irony",
        "literally wtf lmao a complete  in the same damn episode no wonder the teaser got vi just blindly drinking and fighting smh",
        "yeah that was disappointing",
        "if anything vi is the one who changed she was so ready to kill jinx and then changed her mind last second  like what",
        "i dont want them to vi deserves better if a partner hurts you physically its over forever",
        "vi for another  years no please no asdfghj",
        "yeah i dont see a path for them to get back after that",
        "removed",
        "fr when caitlyn did her dirty like that i went out loud stop wtf let the girl breath she cant catch a break damn it",
        "do people recover from crashing out in arcane cuz ive seen no evidence that they do",
        "she will do a",
        "discovered him while watching an assassins creed trailer years ago",
        "i knew that voice sounded familiar ahh brings back memories of that assassins creed trailer",
        "the song was an original made for arcane",
        "probably unpopular and i love woodkid but i agree feels like im watching a music video or cg video game announcement trailer rather than the actual show",
        "tf are you talking about the lyrics literally describe whats going on with the hextech during the scene",
        "she already has her first blaze of glory ruined by silco bringing her back after the bridge",
        "a certain singed experiment that almost certainly has a relation to both of them could be the perfect excuse for a temporary teamup",
        "removed",
        "piltover is open air so the gas is able to dissipate much faster making it not as much of a threat as it is in zaun theres some after effects like with the kid wearing a mask to breathe better",
        "lol skipping over the fact that jinx is in fact a mass murderer",
        "he is literally jesus",
        "that was the unnamed mage from s episode  the one who saved jayce and his mother from cold exposure jayces memories are mixing with reality originally he saw the mage holding the entire world in the palm of his hand\n\nhis whole obsession with the arcane stems from that moment in his childhood",
        "jayce said what have we done\n\njayce oppenheimer talus",
        "well they setup the conditions for the arcane to start fucking things up pretty sure thats what jayce meant when he said that",
        "i for one welcome my new supreme leader caitlyn o",
        "i read it as ambessa having a gripleash on her throat because of the position she just accepted",
        "exactly i love these little details they  really show the amount of thought put into every episode",
        "its clear that theyre just roommates",
        "agreed i feel a bit overwhelmed with caits pretty rapid moral switch up\n\nit would be a rapid turn for a different character but it fits cait pretty well lets remember that in s she was a cop who was practically unaware that poverty existed until she happened to visit zaun in person she was shocked and offended by what she saw but she could only be shocked about it because she was a rich noble and working cop who had spent zero seconds in her entire life thinking about inequality\n\nshes exactly the kind of rich kid who can be convinced by a pretty girl to be vaguely compassionate towards the less fortunate under absolutely ideal circumstances and thats as far as shell go during peacetime shed vaguely disapprove that innocent children in zaun are forced to live in a toxic environment if someone pointed it out to her the second that cait suffers any misfortune herself she announces that its time to gas the animals\n\n\nscratch a liberal and a fascist bleeds is not a universally true statement but cait is written as a perfect candidate",
        "honestly not your fault its a lot and i think  minutes extra on each episode would have helped",
        "no hes not from the game his name is lorice ive now learnt",
        "probably vander and graysons bastard son",
        "my exact concerns too many plotlines not enough time i think",
        "for some reason its strange for me to see people that are like really into arcane and dont seem to play league of legends at all \ni mean the otherworldly villain and the scientist guy experiment \nbut it shows how good arcane is",
        "oh please check out his music hes got such a unique style iron is the song that introduced me to him",
        "hes a french singersongwriterartist done lots of songs for assassins creed trailers and other stuff as well he sang to ashes and blood in episode",
        "jinx also has superpowers courtesy of shimmer really its ridiculous that bogstandard human vi can keep up with shimmerenhanced jinx but plot will plot",
        "she does seem like shed be sticky and her fighting style could arguably be described as between solid and liquid",
        "haha im forever the optimist while jinx is in it for the anarchy im secretly hoping with all the chem barons being taken out that the zaunites needing to band together theyll start making the people of piltover see the dark path theyre going down echo feels like a fitting person to bring a wholesome alternative leadership can imagine sevika partnering up with the firelights one can only hope",
        "i think its only natural look these  were together right from the start they have had people come in and out of their lives but one cosntant was they both had each other then silco happened but still both yearned for each other\n\nso when the time came their shared love which once existed overpowered anythig else it makes sense",
        "osp mentioned raaah\n\ntheir detail diatribe on arcane is amazing i just love it",
        "in the moment i think shes just trying to save jinx theres some grand wisdom here about issues with violence if caitlyn kills jinx this commits caitlyn to some very uncaitlynlike actions and maybe screws up her entire life even more she opens season stating her ideals again about how hex tech isnt going to save them if jinx is killed in front of isha this maybe perpetuates the cycle of violence by creating another jinxtype person in isha however thats a lot of intellectual shit and vi has just been fighting for her life in that moment shes probably just running on a feeling and that feeling is she doesnt want her sister to die",
        "i am still on the fence there situation was a little different though they didnt mean to kill the kid and vi was only trying to make him feel better afterwards if cait shot isha it would have been intentional and that is hard to come back from",
        "we all know cait aint gonna miss that shot lol",
        "she was just saying that cause she was obsessed with getting her sister back these people are obsessed with revenge when a character is obsessed with revenge in arcane they almost do anything even things they normally would do or say",
        "bro ikr  i also really hate these whole little montage things that are used basically as a fast forward it really disconnects me from the characters and the scene i think it would be cooler if they mixed it showing the montage of the characters doing smth like the bit at the beginning of act  ep  and then also jumping to the real characters watching a quick what feels like cutscene just doesnt do it for me",
        "looked like there was a sort of vip section as well she walks up and flashes the letter to a guard who lets her in and she goes behind jayce then another guy disguised as a guard goes in and drops off the bag holding her weapon when vi tries to follow after him she gets stopped from entering the same section",
        "ah that makes sense  \nthanks",
        "characters doing basic intel isnt a plot hole",
        "no what she was trying to do was hunt down jinx and take out the scapegoat before it turned into a fullscale war like vander wanted \n\n  \ni agree that youre not supposed to look at this in a positive light tho\n\nshe saved that kid but she was also trying to save cait theres probably not a lot of people who can come back from sniping down a kid if jinx lives true to her name that action would have ruined her no matter what she did for the rest of her life",
        "thats the point of my comment yeah",
        "happy squeals now she better be alive at the end of the seasonseries",
        "my trans radar was beeping too",
        "removed",
        "removed",
        "removed",
        "removed",
        "thats a good point forgot that happened in that order nice catch",
        "a contain war playing both side a nice testbed for new levels of chemtech and hextech weaponry and ambessa walks away with the spoils whilst both sides are left with rubble",
        "why specifically she chose caitlyn is not spelled out\n\n  \nits pretty much spelled out she asked salo why caitlyn has so much backing and he said because she is a kiramann",
        "yeah while watching episode  as ambessas manipulation is revealed i really wanted to pin her as the ultimate bad guy until i realize that shes simply providing the tools to each person that shes manipulating if the chainsaw chembaron whose son was killed by jayce had an opportunity on her own to take revenge on her son she wouldve attacked one way or another if not now then later and were already seeing caits increasing internal hatred towards the zaunites the zaunites understandably have their own reasons to fight the topover folks it doesnt take that much for an outsider like ambessa to see these threads and make use of them for her own gain ambessa is a brilliant antagonist in this arc",
        "very well explained i must say thank you",
        "the black letter is an invitation to the memorial speech you can see people presenting similar letters to the enforcers to gain entrance before mel starts speaking  the letter and veil let the chembaron just walk right in",
        "i dont play lol or know the lore but saw on another thread someone talking about how noxus is loosing to their enemies atm and ambessa wants the tech to massacre them and also the support from piltover to do that or something like that i may have butchered that but yeah",
        "why they described the game as being to arcane what super smash bros is to super mario bros  to say that absolutely characters can die in arcane and still be playable in the game",
        "its a terrible decision if riot intends to make the game the center of the lore instead of declaring it noncanon if they have to keep all champions alive because they are playable in game that will defeat any of their story telling goals i hope they intend to keep the game as nonrepresentative of the lore",
        "right and when a series does such an arc again it is normally to have it end tragically the other way",
        "i also have a hard time getting it and currently dont have time to rewatch  but ambessa came to piltover with her army corrupted salo by promising him stuff cheated the zaun royals by inviting them to the memorial and then killing them to use them as a prop for the speech like see we need to attack these monsters they cant even respect a memorial to rile up the ppl and chose caitlyn to lead them into zaun for a massacre did i get it right  but also why did she kill gramma on that ship and what business does she have taking zaun is it about the crystals damn idk my attention span is getting worse",
        "i also got confused with the rose magic situation  why was gramma on the ship and who took mel and why was her assistant possessed or something who even is this clan am i dumb",
        "it feels like that because it is like that the only one who was allowed to speak only did it to give clunky exposition to the audience if this is show didnt have such good art style it wouldve been less than mid",
        "also waiting  years between season doesnt help with recall of the previous seasons if i binged it all at once id probably get it but remembering a day span in  without having played much of the game is one hell of an ask",
        "dont know anything about the lore and follow along fine and love kinda figuring things out through context clues\n\neverything youve explained was clear to me as that type of viewer and its not hard to follow at all for me\n\ni think you might be more concerned about the lore and explaining it to people because you think its essential when its really not\n\nits like watching lord of the rings with a massive lore junkie and they feel the need to explain how gandalf can summon the birds its unneeded but a lore person might make the assumption it doesnt make sense to the viewer because regardless of the lore you can and should be able to come up with a valid reason for the events in the story",
        "i think in a book format it would work so well\n\nbut for a show it feels pretty hectic it feels like the animators wanted to flex on us with the cool visuals and  mini music videos every episode",
        "it just wasnt as effective since the topsiders had better ways of dealing with it \n\nbigger reasons would be the open air the relatively small amount of gas and the fact that piltover people were free to run away this was a surprise attack the damage was done and the gas was dissipated before any tech came into play\n\nhence the shot of the child with the oxygen mask at the end\n\npeople in zaun do have masks and medicine and its not like the kid in the mask is showing a better recovery than people in zaun who received the same dose what the shot of the kid in the mask reminds us of is that piltover people think that a single piltover child being exposed to this gas for a few seconds is a historic tragedy that demands public grieving and ceremony\n\nwhich presents an obvious contrast to how piltover people think about zaunite children being exposed to the gas",
        "oh i see thank you",
        "finally",
        "well here i am brother lost in space together",
        "if hextech is the action wild runes are the reaction or the consequence i see it as analogous to how humans harnessing power from the industrial revolution on has led to mass polluting of the earth but were not entirely sure if wild runes are bad for the planethumanity or if there is a benefit to them  \n\nekko jumps to the conclusion that the hextech towers are polluting their tree with wild runes because of the ducts that the tower shares with the rest of the underground",
        "i think the build up in season  act  is the best ive ever seen",
        "ekko made the jump cause he is super smart \n\nits called foreshadowing thats what the wild runes are about also wild runes wasnt a big step from the hexcore",
        "i fully agree so far the pace has been going too fast for me in act i caitlyn has had multiple almost scenetoscene switch ups in her character going from timid kid to literal dictator in the span of  episodes same with her relationship to vi that one is a bit more consistent to me but the cuts between her being super sweet with vi and then a super strict cop felt a bit jarring to me they finally kissed but i cant be the only one for whom that felt kinda forced\n\nplus they tacked on a  bunch of stuff now that i worry they might not be able to resolve by the end of the season the grey the black rose the wild runes all seemed to come out of nowhere and i really worry where its gonna end up especially the black rose arc to me seems too much\n\nevery episode seems to have an epic battle and a montage and while thats cool visually i feel like were losing time for the quiet personal moments and especially the lead up to them that makes them feel earned thats what scares me the most for the rest of the season tbh",
        "goat episode for me",
        "while i in no way would say i dislike s so far it does seem that some higherup watched youtube reactions to s and said write that down write that down apparently every episode now needs an epic battle and a music montage",
        "i believe that may have been the point that vi was going down a darker path upholding a broken system ignoring the gas finding ways to justify it to herself before seeing the child protecting jinx put the idea in her head that just as jinx is the monster she created vi and cait too are now ontrack to become the monsters she always feared from childhood enforcers shooting those adults children care about in front of those chidren just as her parents were killed  that one was not supposed to be agreeing with vis and caits actions this episode\n\ni have been getting a wilson wilson tragic villain feel from cait this season and i will be thoroughly impressed if the creatives have the gall to commit to it where the narrative would demand her story end end for it to have integrity",
        "silcos henchmen are absolutely juiced to the gills if were talking about the suited up ones with it but yes i did forget she was shimmered up too\n\nstill doesnt make much sense to me with vi wearing gauntlets",
        "i mean thematically it makes more sense for the sisters to fight each other",
        "yeah true i saw that kid but like thats it seemed kind of pointless lol",
        "yeah like just go take a bath",
        "i caught this as well wasnt a fan",
        "took the words right outta my mouth felt very well the plot needs cait to win so here we gooooo\n\n even with a questionable arm upgrade if sevika gets in close shes dusting cait with a single arm leg forehead anything\n\nanother nitpick was vi not using her shield at all youd think that after the events of s leading up to vi saying make jayce give me the gauntlets she wouldve at some point asked about that lifesaving shield",
        "that could have been better conveyed like having the other two enforcers just give a knowing nod when they see him or him embarrassingly trying to hide the bottles of alcohol when he sees them approaching instead of pretend to be asleep",
        "im pretty sure both have blue orbs",
        "she was probably thinking boy i missed a lot in prison",
        "i am beyond annoyed with vi my goodness f that kid one little snot nosed gremlin getting knocked off vs all of the people thatll die because of jinx seriously",
        "ikr and there were so many openings even if the kid was on top of jinx i think cait couldve made the shot",
        "with jinxs this isnt how its supposed to go its giving is there anything so undoing as a daughter to me has been since the character was introduced in episode",
        "got it thanks a lot for the answers clears things up\n\ncan i ask one more question in s we see very few hextech crystals which only jayce has and then jinx steals some of them where then did they get all these crystals to build all this hex technology",
        "its funny how jinx is so feared in piltover and is considered as a massive threat to all but all the poor girl wants is to settle her feud with her sister",
        "yeah especially since she told caitlyn  before the fight to use the chance to shoot jinx if she gets one",
        "no that song is fantastic im referring to the one that plays during the opening scene of cait and crew clearing out the sewers",
        "the soundtrack is fucking amazing what a crazy take",
        "yeah i dont mind it all sets a mood  the show does really well with it",
        "the real conflict was vi not wanting cait to change and the cait she knew wouldnt have risked the life of a child\n\ni also love that vi still has her golden heart despite it all \n\nwhich means shes gonna hit rock bottom in act",
        "removed",
        "you mean singeds monster",
        "well the monster is a big bad wolf but im not sure if were allowed to say his name in here or not if you play lol you know who it is i didnt know singed created him though i know  about the lore haha",
        "makes sense thank you",
        "yeah it was cool to have one fight like that but now almost every fight seems to in that style",
        "i didnt like how it cut to what jayce was doing and then it would cut back to the fight it kind of killed the momentum but i can understand story wise there was something connected going there so they did it that way to tell a bigger overall story",
        "they definitely noticed caitlyn had a shot on sevika but the gun crackling made her drop it in pain plus she also used the fizzing as a weapon against sevika at one point \n\nvi also had a few moments where she couldnt lift her fists from the ground due to the crackling",
        "man everybody got asbestos in their lungs now",
        "well i wasnt sure thats why i was wondering but thanks for clearing it up",
        "hold up give me a secondi need to thinkvery deeply by the corner really quickly",
        "the mage in the beginning had runic tattoos and a wooden staff we have already seen what happened to viktors hands and if you rewatch se you can see the mage has normal fingers inscribed with tattoos",
        "thanks so much i do recall that now",

        "have they confirmed how much time has passed since the previous episode im assuming something like  months to a year is that accurate",
        "i was hoping this season would get better but its getting worse much worse arcane season  was a  show for me phenomenonal writing amazing action sequences well placed songs \n\nthis season higher budget but dead action sequences its littered with slow motion and still paintings overuse of voiced soundtracks its like im watching someones spotify playlist with ai generated backgrounds \n\n different plots with no central plot what was  million spent on zoomed in messy shots scott pilgrim esq cheese popping off with every jinx scene i cant be the only one this let down so far",
        "i guess im not surprised by the reaction of some vocal people about caitlyn and maddie but lets sum it up from caitlyns perspective\n\ncaitlyn  \n lost her mother  \n lost her father to grief  \n has to inherited her houses title and position something she doesnt think she deserves  \n wants a chance to doover the mistake that led to her mothers death  \n in her attempt she loses the person shes developed a deep and complicated romantic attachment to because  \n that person seems to choose her sister who murdered caitlyns mom over caitlyn  \n is immediately appointed the military leader of her city and has all that responsibility thrust on her  \n loses her best friend and semimentor completely  \n now is in a bizarre tense mentormentee relationship with a noxian warlord she doesnt trust  \n doubts her mentor and herself and has to juggle finding jinx and keeping the cities from descending into chaos\n\nbut god forbid the fact caitlyn might need a little solace in her life",

        "the scene where jinx broke the prisoners out and the prisoners warmly tapped her shoulder had so much depth almost brought me to tears now i see that the underground people were just feeling bad for her and wanted to know if shes okay\n\nfrom their perspective jinx had misfortune befell to her ever since she was a kid her parents died her sister abandons her and her adopted father died shes all alone in the world",
        "i hope this is fight announcer bit leads to a rebel underground radio station thatd be hilarious",
        "that was awesome better than any of the first three episodes",
        "the ending made me cry when he said powder fuck",
        "tripped me out that the call for rebellion was so strong that the firelights were willing to work with all the other zaunites even the criminal gangs to unify against piltovers forces \n\ni think ekko wouldve made a difference if he had been there and hadnt got caught up in whatever the fuck happened down with that hextech reactor thing",

        "well maddie and cait just came out of nowhere no buildup or anything i liked her in the first arc but saw her more as a child looking up to cait and vi not a potential love interest\n\nim really starting to see why people have been complaining about this season condensing storylines that should have been spread out across multiple seasons especially since it seems like every episode is now going to start out with these abstract musical montages which convey something happening as a summary rather than showing us the normal way and allowing the full weight of the story to sink in",

        "wait so what happened to vi and others they dead or something what am i missing",
        "am i the only hater  the shows beautiful but i feel like they went too fast into jinx just healing and loving someonefrom s ending isha doesnt have character except for being powders flashback making her mute almost added to it and feels almost a bit lazy like shes there to just positively stir the pot how did jinx become the symbol she hasnt even once spoken publicly from what i knoware these people as desperate and needy as american society waiting for one prominent person to wave a flag and drop a promise to make them the divine leader warwick speaking",

        "ambessa wants violence she doesnt really care that much about piltover and zaun shes a warrior who wants to fight and basically is using this revolution as a proxy war to test out and perfect hextech weapons then once she has those shed likely run back home to noxus and crush her enemies not caring about the mess she made",
        "jinx seems actually more human next to isha they are so cute cant wait to have my heart broken yet again  and when she mentioned not doing that with her sister",
        "before this me and others that isha had almost no screentime of her and jinx bonding to the point of even not talking but i am pretty sure this episode revealed she is mute and i felt guilty about even complaining about that detail",

        "i think i heard a year as well",
        "i didnt feel any time skip i mean perhaps youre right but jayce ekko and heimer just disappear for an entire year what about the black rose they just took mel and do nothing after that for an entire year this bloody better make sense",
        "a year doesnt fit because a child as small as isha would definitely show some aging in a year she doesnt look a day older so a few months tops",

        "maddies definitely a rebound",
        "honestly she didnt seem that interested in maddie during the scenes i wonder if cait is just desperate for physical affection since she doesnt have it with vi and with maddies hero worship it just made sense to fall into bed with her maddie also didnt seem like she was listening to caits worries so i doubt its a very deep relationship if its one at all lol",
        "that looked like an ape rather than a wolf",

        "i genuinely hated that we had so much buildup for just a kiss between caitlyn and vi and then cait just goes and bangs maddie offscreen it made what she had with vi feel so small and cheap\n\nim not even mad at either of the characters im more mad at the writers for deciding to go there",
        "to be fair to maddie she did tell cait that she can call off martial law and stop all of this but cait still insists on getting jinx thinking about it i am surprised people are more mad at maddie than cait it is a bit like getting more mad at the person who was cheated with than the cheater themselves who is in a pretty fascist state right now",
        "this was by far the easiest to follow compared to act  though",
        "what the hell singed yeager",
        "for real i mean they have a relatioship",
        "who is its stupid and pointless wont even last long either",
        "i appreciated the fact maddie was a voice of reason and that caitlyn retained hers even if she enabled some bad shit in the meantime",
        "id go so far as to say that maddies the only innocent party in the whole thing albeit she may or may not have known about cait and vi prior to it all but thats conjecture and not actually shown in the show\n\nat the end of the day shes done literally nothing to warrant any sort of hate  and i sure as hell hope that shippers keep it in their pants and leave katy townsend alone",
        "seems silly to criticise any of their decisions\n\n\nfirst its clearly been some time since episode  i doubt cait immediately jumped in bed with maddie immediately after\n\n\nsecond and no offense to caitvi shippers but their relationship was pretty much the definition of its complicated they spend a rd of the series together romantically another rd split apart after an argument and the last rd in trauma inducing situations of violence its not surprising that things got a bit messy\n\n\nim still hoping caitvi is the end goal though",
        "lovely characterisation jinx stays a jinx \n\n  \n singed is probably the most selfish character in the show lmao all he does is solely to further the goal of reviving his daughter\n\n yeah cait is using maddie i think",
        "if anything caitlyn should be getting shit for dating maddie as shes clearly just using her to cope and isnt anywhere near as much into it as she is which is probably not gonna go down very smoothly if caitlyn and vi end up together again",
        "yeah i like that maddie was wary of ambessa rather than just going along with everything she does  and i liked how shes constantly trying to encourage caitlyn when shes dejected\n\nbut as far as maddie and caitlyn go i think that relationship might already be over  there was a night scene at the memorial where caitlyn looks back at maddie in x  caitlyn looks sad apologetic at least thats the vibe i was getting  and maddie looked hurt and disappointed  she stared at caitlyn for a moment before lowering her head looking defeated  or heartbroken",
        "singed is team nobody he has no loyalty to anyone",
        "i think she was about to leave and the only way to leave is through those cable car thingy",
        "she is supervising the mass incarcerations",
        "i agree with pretty much everything you said  people seem to gloss over or minimize what exactly caitlyn went through  \n\ni think another point is that caitlyn didnt really have a support network  she lost her mother broke up with vi due to what happened in x her father is despondent and jayce is busy with viktor  she would be feeling alone and isolated on top of being appointed to a position she never wanted  so its understandable she would want to feel some human connection have some kind of outlet for her emotions and maddie was someone who was clearly so devoted to her  its clear caitlyn doesnt feel the same affection that maddie does by the start of act  but maybe caitlyn was in an emotional place where she really needed it and it helped her stay afloat emotionally after act",
        "and as a side note i feel like its also great gay representation right\n\nshowing how its not always roses and sunshine but how gay people can be flawed and make serious mistakes or be kind of an asshole in relationships too\n\nlike hurting other people by using them to cope with your own issues or not being able to reciprocate their feelings and give them the attention theyd deserve because youre still not over someone else\n\nyknow just like everybody else",
        "strength in numbers pretty clear to me",
        "a lot of the writing in this part is questionable and does not really hold up to questions like this  \nit was written like that simply because it would put them in teh perfect situation to have the warwick scene",
        "her giving them hope to fight back  and them giving her purpose  beautiful",
        "its the same as when people get mad at the person their partner cheated with rather than at the partner\n\nexcept even more dissonant as maddie only got with caitlin after she abandoned vi",
        "presumably ekko has been gone for months to a year theyre leaderless and desperate so the call for a united zaun is appealing",
        "i read about how we were gonna hate maddie i expected her to maybe kill isha or somethibg like that\n\ni did not expect this twist true evil",
        "the prisoners touching jinx made me bawl\n\nbeautiful scene the way they are handling jinx this season is masterful",
        "the only thing better on s are the visuals everything else s is superior",
        "seems like a year given the flowers on the grave but maybe not",
        "i think he is drive testing ww there is probably some failsafe mechanism that stops it from killing him considering that it is following his blood",
        "he locked himself back in his cell just before warwick enters i guess the cell bars are stronger than whatever  other metal hes shredded through already haha im not sure what his plan was either",
        "feels like  months to me based on caitlyn saying months of operations rather than a year or something like that",
        "its the shimmer  in situations where her emotions are running high gives her super fast twitchy reflexes at the cost of her sanity",
        "if they just went out of warwicks way most of them probably survived he wasnt there for them after all but trying to get to singeds cell the enforcers were trying to stop him though so most of them were killed",
        "yup i think ww just killed most guards and fugitives",
        "i just want to know how maddie is visibly younger than caitlyn whos already ridiculously young herself for the position she has and is a member of her elite strike team i can at least excuse the romance as the writers showing her getting over vi by scrambling to replace her",
        "how about at the end of s ep  where theres a long shot to vanders body easily foreshadowing that the beasts corpse is intact",
        "sevikas speech made it pretty clear that the jinxers are the ones rallying behind jinx and the firelights dont consider themselves her followers but that they have to learn to be cool with each other",
        "my theory is that when her big colour explosion thing went of she flushed a lot of the grey out of the underground it would fit with her being framed in relation to jana in ep \n\nother possibility is its backlash against the enforcesnoxians shoving people around yelling stop protecting jinx",
        "yeah it doesnt make sense this episode did not work for me at all so many random plot points that arent built up that the audience is just supposed to go along with",
        "i think the seeds of revolution were sowed by silco so the emotion and momentum of that is present in the people of zaun further the fact that jinx had the audacity to attack piltover and makes the topside people fearful of her just gives her a larger than life presence for the people of zaun they think they finally have someone they can rally behind\n\nif they hand her over who else can they stand behind things will be like they were before\n\nits about the bigger picture jinx is someone who has stood up to the piltovers even if from the shadows its now or never\n\nalso people just like rebels those who are against the status co",
        "the people dont know that she killed silco or that the council was going to grant them independence\n\nfor the people of zaun shes just fighting for their freedom while using extreme methods they dont care that shes killed a bunch of people in piltover but they do care about the violence commited against them by the agents\n\nthe firelights are just directioneless because they lost ekko",
        "shes actually quite petite",
        "the subtitles had a spoiler lol",
        "vander",
        "yes vander is warwick",
        "how did jinx become a symbol bruh  \n\n kills half the council \n\n becomes the most wanted person \n\n turns the gray into piltover putting on a show for everyone\n\nand apparently people also knew she was vanders daughter \n\nhow could she not be a symbol for people occupied and oppressed by piltover and a foreign nation\n\njinx wasnt that broken to begin with if she was as devoid of human emotion she wouldve killed vi and cait in episode  jinx wasnt a bloodlusted killer without humanity lol she just couldnt decide who to be",
        "the show does timeskips it may seem too fast for viewers but inuniverse a lot more time passed s act  to act  for example was a timeskip same for in between every other act",
        "the problem when a show that should be a higher number of seasonsepisodes gets squeezed into  a lot of hand waving to get to the next plot beat unfortunately",
        "the time skip is not that long what do you mean by pacing anyway its actually very normally paced",
        "she seems overly attached  deffo gonna turncoat",
        "i feel this and also know how production schedules can work maybe the animation was based on audio that was an earier version of ashnikkos work shrug",
        "gets mauled to death",
        "jinx is cool but you are not only a clown but the whole fucking circus with these pants",
        "i know but its still hilarious lmao",
        "jigsaw logic he didnt escape so he must have wanted to die",
        "the mysterious someone who put all those holes in him did it",
        "when i say i got chills dude",
        "tbf at the height she jumped from it would have likely knocked outkilled the big dude if he were a normal human ofc everyone in arcane seems to have super strength and durability especially soldiers like him",
        "she straight up looks like a fuckin vampire with that cape and high collar",
        "i have this gut feeling you wont need to  bucks says shes dead before this season ends",
        "i cant believe all the memes about lesbian maddie being into auth cait had  foresight",
        "so glad im not the only one hating maddie now",
        "i think that was partly on purpose to emphasize a lot of time has passed since the last episode",
        "oh dang you right in my defense i was audibly cackling at this scene and misheard the words",
        "halfeaten",
        "if you had subtitles on otherwise im not sure\n\nedit jinx does say her name when isha goes missing at the rally",
        "its like that weapon in breath of the wild with the crazy high damage and the stupidly low durability",
        "but it was so fun",
        "the finn mertens curse",
        "good riddance fuck that guy",
        "he got ripped indeed",
        "i hope she didnt get killed by vander",
        "yeah i dont want to binge it plus the whole arc discussions diminishes what happens in each episodes",
        "im also thankful i came here looking for answers about the final scene and i would have hated to be spoiled by discussions about episodes  and  \n\nvander is back baby",
        "same im so confused",
        "nah it as been teased in a lot of occasions in s\n\n warwicks background describes him as a man who was trying to turn away from a life of crime which fits vander perfectly the only thing warwick remembers from his past is a little girl crying out a name which is likely powder calling after vi in episode  in the game he recognizes jinx\n\n also in the game warwick asks vi who taught her how to punch vander did\n\n vander is known as the hound of the underworld\n\n when silco says ill show them what you really are to vander warwicks theme music plays also he calls him a lapdog\n\n monster vander sounded very similar to warwick\n\n in the last episode jinxs vision of vander has wolf outlines\n\n vanders voice actor once played a talking dog\n\nsource",
        "i hear viktors not a fan of this pun",
        "what if theyre transported to a different spacetime and reappear just when e everyone else is about to die lol",
        "she originally lost her arm from powders bomb that killed the rest of the crew in season  episode",
        "a kind of neat thing is that since shes mute isha is the one person jinx doesnt have to fear being added to the voices in her head",
        "jinx is mentally unwell but it seems like when she gets away from the hyperviolent world of the zaun criminal underground shes mostly able to curb her psychopathic tendencies its too bad that circumstances and politics keep pulling her back in in another life powder and vi could have had the simple lives of an inventor and a boxer who has to occasionally cover up why their neighbors pets go missing",
        "it was a great callback to his introduction",
        "w was active",
        "ya the jinxers arent that crazy",
        "i hated it  they did her dirty",
        "i remember i think in ep  this same bald guy had plugged in a heart with giant fluid machine there is some big story there as well as to how he preserved vander",
        "i was surprised when she chose to sacrifice herself in the battle against beast mutantvander and told sevika to run off with isha deep down the desire to do good as she originally wished is still there",
        "yeah i was thinking a few weeks to a few months at most\n\n  \nedit spoilers for like five minutes into the next episode it was a few months",
        "we were decieved\n\nwe were blindsided \n\nwe were betrayed",
        "i think that caitlynmaddie relationship might already be over\n\nthere was that nighttime cemetery scene with caitlyn and maddie  caitlyn has her back turned to maddie and maddie is several feet away  caitlyn looks back with a sad almost guilty look on her face  and maddie looks back with a disappointed hurt expression before looking down  nothing was said but the impression i got was that caitlyn was ending things with maddie  possible\n\nso maddie does still live but she may not be staying with caitlyn anymore after that scene",
        "episode  i swear if arcane decides to kill off maddie  \nepisode  i dare you to confront vi i dare you",
        "it was the first scene after the intro how can you not be pissed",
        "year max but probably less isha looks a bit taller but not that much taller id guess three months at a minimum for the noxians to get so entrenched and sevika to get three groups that would normally try to kill each other on sight to even think about cooperating",
        "the montages keep speeding through the most interesting parts",
        "no it was five to six months",
        "poor maddie i wonder if she even realizes shes the doormat rebound while cait dreams of her muscle mommy",
        "pls singed is just alpha testing him full release coming soon tm",
        "of course its misha   \n  \nthat fucking tone is just perfect",
        "it was brilliant she was playing up the joke of her own importance to diminish its impact on her own emotions as if disregarding the entire movement behind her identity and that whole illusion is destroyed from human touch from her followers its just simple marvellous the touch and it breaks her barriers without a single word and they let the rest of the scene sink in as everyone leaves\n\njust love love love it",
        "in the old prearcane lore singed had some of the best and also most terrifying lore hes been very influential throughout the entire world of runeterra but its uncertain wether singed will play that same role in the new lore we knew he was working on warwick since the end of season  but who knows where hes going from here there are some likely things going to happen but who knows if he will have the same global influence as in the old lore\n\nhavent seen the rest of the episodes but so far hes responsible for a juiced up jinx kept viktor alive for what comes next and revived warwickall while tinkering silently in the background the guy is already putting in massive work its insane",
        "well there is definitely some time skip of an undefined length feels like months to me at the very least",
        "agree she practically recoiled at maddies touch she might be fucking her to cope with the loss of vi but their relationship isnt intimate",
        "yeah anytime maddie tried to be soft with her you could clearly see caitlyn recoil a bit and she also started getting this far off look in her eyes\nplease dont let this be lethal doses of copium",
        "she could barely look maddie in the eyes she is not remotely over vi",
        "yeah when caitlyn smiles at maddies touch its like a smile meant purely for maddies benefit rather than an honest reaction  wondering what it was like when the relationship started  and is maddie not aware of how caitlyn reacts to her touch or is she just assuming caitlyn is thinking about the situation in zaun",
        "yeah true im hard coping im in shambles",
        "the way she can essentially teleport with shimmer will always look awesome",
        "dont even think maddie knows caitlyn and vi used to be a thing",
        "that seems like an insane gamble even if warwick doesnt kill him then and there betting on ambessa or caitlyn both of whom he didnt know to cooperate with a mad scientist with a clear lack of morals and respect for human lives was risky to say the least i guess he was that desperate for funding",
        "im not confused im just sad",
        "ive seen fish with more life in their eyes than her caitlyn isnt living her best life right now",
        "whats the point of becoming a militant dictator if you cant even sleep with the president of your fan club whos also your direct subordinate",
        "at least the writers spared us from seeing other things i would have been really pissed off",
        "i dont mind you can have a long buildup for a kiss with someone you love and have quick im sad and alone sex that doesnt cheapen vis relationship",
        "act  had a lot of info dump and time jump true but it all logically connected one way or the other part  we dont even know how long the time skip has been cus characters look the same age wise the beast thing too and more black rose in the next ep like just so much confusion maybe the show is leaning into its fantasy more",
        "albeit she may or may not have known about cait and vi prior to it all\n\neven if she knew its not like cait is currently dating vi its fair game",
        "im not sure if their emotions at that moment were regarding their relationship but i am sure that it will come to an end cait looks to have a rebound relationship with maddie and ought to get back with vi please",
        "idk they had noxian guards enforcers and probably even had plans in place for a prison riot if vander hadnt already killed many of the enforcers cant imagine theyd get far",
        "surely it hasnt been that long i would have guessed a few weeksmonths at most",
        "isnt caitlyn like  at most maddie is probably not younger just petite",
        "the first idea makes sense caitlyns strike force was basically terrorizing many parts of the undercity especially with the grey the people obviously arent happy about that then as far as the people are aware jinx scared  of them off and kicked the other twos asses afterwards she flushed out all of the grey that was contaminating many streets letting the folks there breathe again\n\nnot to mention people likely have already known that jinx alongside sevika was the righthandman of silcothe undercitys late de facto leaderso its only natural that theyd be more inclined to trust her",
        "since nobody considered her a symbol in part  only point  on your list could have been the cause  \nbut how would the masses in ther underground actually know that it was her\n\njust because you do not see the issues with the writingm doesnt mean others have to eat it up aswell",
        "it not being long is kind of the point the characters feel like theyre in jarringly different places than they were not one episode ago its like all character growth was done off screen jinx suddenly has a new sister like relationship with this kid she barely cared about in act  theres barely any aftermath surrounding the ending of act  outside of apparently stricter rules for the zaunites worst of all for me is cait barring the fact that she just starts a relationship with a character shes barely spoken to off screen all the tension they built up at the end of act  implied she was going to continue decending down the dark path we saw her start on but then in this episode she gets mad at ambessas men for shoving the zaunites around cait just one episode ago you were using your mothers life work to gas the citizens of the underworld and threatened to shoot a child it feels like theyre trying to rush past a bunch of character development by just throwing in a time skip",
        "yea i didnt feel like the time skip really hurt the viewing experience or story\n\nthat said i dont think its very normally paced at all i feel like too much happens too quickly sometimes\n\n efor example had a part that felt jarring to me how quick things happened with the raiders attack jayce almost dying immediately back to making crazy sick gear and then the group rolling out to wreck the underground \n\nall prevalent critique in this sub is aimed at the pacing too so it does seem to be a general feeling a lot of viewers have",
        "no but seriously i immediately clocked that as jinx trying to escape the pain and responsibility by blaming it on someone else  powder\n\ni think she subconsciously does blame herself for silcos death but the trauma of acknowledging it is so overbearing that it instead deepens her dissociation and splitting of personas\n\nit was only when silco threatened vi at gunpoint that powder finally won out the battle of a mental turmoil and shot him to protect her sister if powder is to blame then that leaves jinx guiltless its easier to live with less guilt jinx lives on and leans in to everything that powder isnt",
        "the entire cast of twilight got nothing on her",
        "she already was but this decreased her chances of survival dramatically",
        "man i hope not not unless she actually deserves it for something thats actually heinous and not who she sleeps with",
        "i kinda hope vi gets a faceoff with her of some kind before that happens",
        "maybe its just me but i would have liked it they just flat out said how much time has past i know they did in ep  so i cant complain too much i think just leaving it ambiguous is frustrating for viewers trying to add everything up and make everything make sense",
        "imo it would be pretty cool if jinx named her",
        "rest in pieces indeed",
        "exactly they are too jampacked with moments and details that are lost if we only have  discussion per batch",
        "nice catch",
        "damn",
        "oh man as a former league player watching this with my nonleague friends it takes everything in my soul to keep my composure whenever i recognize a callback to the game i screamed he ulted for ekko in season  and they looked at me like i was insane\n\nalso squealed when the windy lady popped up they are tired of me lol",
        "put some respect on singeds name",
        "i think part of that is that shes basically suicidal to be fair i dont think shed mind getting killed at all",
        "exactly this is definitely one of my favorite scenes in this show  she might have been twisted by silco but the innocent good natured girl named powder is still buried deep inside jinx",
        "i think it had to do with caitlyns own mourning\n\nthe way i see it is vi was confronting the way cait started to think about bringing justice for her mothers death and establishing peace at cost of oppressionkilling so vi was not a good match for caits own turmoil  selfdetermination\n\non other hand maddie seemed like someone who validated caits every emotion  thoughts so basically cait ended up with maddie as a rebound after personal crisis all the while despite every validation cait doesnt get any peace or satisfaction so obviously shes dissatisfied with the relationship and with her personalpolitical vision as well\n\nso i think maddie is hurt that cait is still not happy despite everything maddie is trying to do for cait\n\nto add this remember how ambeesa made a passing remark to always see maddie hanging around and that cryptic statement professional entanglements directed towards knowledge of their relationship\n\ni think this all is finally catching up on both lovers\n\nedit spelling mistakes",
        "is that really the interesting part you would prefer seeing them setting up checkpoints and oppressing zaun for a month for an episode over like actual plot advancement",
        "i somehow agree that the timeskips minimum would be  months have you seen all their hair grown and structures being built isha was taller if it hasnt been a year",
        "and honestly the people mad cait is in another relationship are forever alone nutjobs who cant even get one",
        "or are yall just coping face it vicaitlyn shall never be its madlyn now",
        "but sometimes riot does the obvious too so who knows its just that shes way too sweet for this universe right next to isha",
        "i dont think warwick is a threat for him he wouldnt be calm otherwise\n\nand ambessa and caitlyn would clearly want to know about the most dangerous creature in the verse so far lol \n\nits still a gamble dont get me wrong i agree the thought process isnt that clear like what if he killed ambessa  and he still needed it to revive her daughter i think we need to wait for act",
        "that seems like an insane gamble\n\nthis is singed were talking about",
        "i feel you",
        "still a knockout though the kind of military dictator hugo boss would be proud to dress",
        "i agree with you in theory but emotionally this turn of events has made me sad",
        "caitlyn says its been months its definitely easier to follow imo ep focusing  on zaun was a huge help instead of too much characterlocation spread",
        "pretty sure act  happened for a week or  after the rocket hell everything from se to se happened in less than a month zaun was occupied by piltovers allied noxx forces at the end of act  and theres a year time skip\n\never heard of pancho villa he was one of the most ruthless killers and bandits in his days he terroirized innocent people yet hes literally regarded as a hero in the mexican revolution i didnt even learn about the atrocities he committed until i was an adult hell i still dont know what he did just that he was a bad person\n\nin times of war and oppression people latch on to hope whatever form it takes and jinx is an anti status quo symbol itd make no sense for her not to be the face of a movement after her grandiose acts against piltover",
        "nah most viewers are fine",
        "the other possibilities are that shes able to write at least her name shes able to speak its just so difficult andor painful andor super quiet when she tries that she usually doesnt probably not this one there are emergency situations where she would have tried if she could where she doesnt although if at least part of the problem is her being super quiet she might have realized no one would hear her she knows rsl runetera sign language and so does jinx and she finger spelled her name for jinx",
        "spoiler \n\n\njinxs moms name was felicia felicia  isha\n\njinx definitely names her",
        "yeah honestly my favourite scenes are when jinx fightsstands up for something emaningful with full conviction unwavering really like the lane theyve gone with her being a symbol to the undercity",
        "on other hand maddie seemed like someone who validated caits every emotion  thoughts so basically cait ended up with maddie as a rebound after personal crisis all the while despite every validation cait doesnt get any peace or satisfaction so obviously shes dissatisfied with the relationship and with her personalpolitical vision as well   \n\nwell said loved your analysis  and i think the fact that maddie someone that would never challenge caitlyns views or beliefs that would have helped too  i dont think caitlyn is the type who would want a yes person but at that stage she probably appreciated the comfort of someone she wouldnt feel she had to defend her feelings or actions with\n\nre maddie i forgot to mention another reason i thought caitlyn might have ended things in that scene was that we never saw maddie again after that  i know maddie would likely never have been allowed to go with them to zaun but it seemed that maddie wasnt around when caitlyn was investigating the aftermath of what happened in stillwater  but i could be reading too much into that",
        "one of the really common criticisms you get in certain shows that i can never understand is when a show is ruined for people because their ship doesnt come to fruition i like romance plots generally but i am just watching most shows for very different reasons than these people if who ends up fucking who can ruin it for them i guess if love lines or other lines that take precedence over romance are well executed then thats all that matters ill never just pick two people who must fuck and have that define the quality of a show for me\n\ndont even get me started on people who ship real people because of characters they played",
        "dont know if you are serious or not but ill give a serious answer to expand upon my original comment \n\ntbh if cait and vi will not happen i think they both end up alone ill explain why\n\ni just do not think they would have done the buildup of cait and vis relationship which got to a kiss then a violent breakup then the next episode how cait looks body languages eyes her smile that seemed fake or forced in the bed scene with maddie and then just turn it into a yeah cait ended up with maddie just wouldnt make too much sence imo \n\ni do feel very bad for maddie though and i am not one that hates her its cait people should be angry about for playing with maddies feelings if my hypothothes turns out to be correct that is but by how little actually plotrelevence maddie has had i feel there will be more to her in the coming episodes maybe the theories of her being a double agent for black rose is true or shes just simply very good and will die a heroic death \n\nsaturday cant come soon enough i love arcane",
        "yep  the character development in this show is so masterfully good"

        "no way jayce just smashed salo like that this season has been amazing i cant wait to find out what the hell happened in there jayce legitmately looks like he has so much trauma\n\n  \nalso love the family reunion i was emotional as hell the nervousness on jinx face as she wonders if they killed each other or not and its just them embracing each other that was such a perfect moment and that fucking flash back why did they have to show us that i want to see more about that trio i want a prequel and the chemistry between them all is insane you can see why they were such a good team",
        "fun fact my dumbass sister and i were wondering what the s on the jacket best to their dads meant we were like but violet starts with a v jinx starts with a j\nour dumb asses forgot about silco",

        "love that they did a callback to mels love of puzzles with this episode",

        "mel over here being in a completely different movie scribed by clive barker",
        "cant wait to see all the symbolisms and parallels for this season but the one that got me was at the end of the episode where jynx is lighting a lighter in the dark last time she was confident and in control while vi was scared and alone this time its the complete opposite",
        "vi smacking caitlynlookin dude in the party and then flippin him was too good",

        "my god vi holding out her hand to jinx to hug vander fucking got me",
        "the animation is really something else im in awe for  minutes every time",
        "did salo or rather victorguidedsalo somehow release jayce from the arcanes  wild runes grasp seems like he was stuck somewhere for all this time so what made him snap back into reality",
        "seriously i want to know what it is that allows amanda and others to cook up a story this dense impactful and deep\n\njust when i thought they could not spring one new deep and impactful thing they one up themselves \n\ni dont have the skill to write at length about much in this episode i lack the iq and ability but the reunion between vi and jinx the banter finding silco and vanders hideout and then the final confrontation and reunion\n\noh my god a beautiful snapshot of the past of brothers in arms who have the respect and admiration of all involved what a tragedy that they came to blows that circumstances and choices turned them into enemies\n\nthat final hug \n\namanda knows how to cook",

        "i thought silco was sevika for a second but damn that memory was nice",
        "nooo i was hoping mels brother was actually alive\n\n\nedit kinda feel bad for connol felicias beau it seems like he was kinda out of the loop on a lot",
        "vander",
        "this was the best openingcontextreestablishing music montage\n\nnot that i dont like the more stylizedabstract ones from the other episodes but i prefer this\n\nmaybe its because im aware of the time constraints and while very artistically ambitious i cant help but feel somewhat cheated when so much screentime has been spent on what amounts to comicbookesque still frame slideshows\n\nanyway this ep was my favorite so far",
        "wait is that their mom",
        "as some other people have said the pacing is the biggest issue of the season so much has happened but it doesnt feel satisfactorily explained im definitely enjoying it but some of the plot lines need some more depth",
        "i actually cried when vi and vander hugged i think the culmination of the flashback vander named vi jinxs fear for her sister and the slow reveal ripped my heart out and put it back in again ugh vi and jinx needed that hug and i fucking needed it too",
        "rugged jayce is kinda hot",
        "vi going through her goth phase after bad breakup",
        "does anyone know why jinx says hark during the warwick confrontation i know what the word means but the placement is kinda unfitting also an oldtimey word i wouldnt have expected her to use doesnt really matter i was just curious",
        "was that jinx holding up a red card during vis pit fighting scene around  minute in",
        "anyone else noticing a lot of similarities to dune recently caitlyns fascist arc is the most obvious similar to pauls and viktor being able to communicate through people is similar to how you can channel the voices and personalities of your ancestors in the dune universe",
        "who that in the backkkk kino",
        "the family reunion",
        "im all for vis pit fighter glow up grimdown whew",
        "am i the only thats having an issue in how the plot is progressing the pacing feels really off the reunion was so weird",
        "there is something wrong with the pacing please tell me im not alone",
        "vander has mad homophobia",
        "so im a bit confused with the relationship between jinx and vi\n\nso we saw in the last act that the both of them still have a lot of resentment with each other but still ultimately love each other\n\n  \nbut in this episode it feels like jinx is fine with vi vi acts like she hates her until she doesnt \n\n  \ncan someone please explain it because i cant figure it out",
        "im sorry you feel that way well you aint feeling anything anymore",
        "that opening montage is so cool but i hope thats not the last we see of shield guy",
        "corin reveck",
        "did jayce just offed that mf",
        "vi straight up looking like rhea ripley",
        "jinx vi and isha representing young powder hugging vander made me cry so hard wtffffffffff",
        "things to note\n\n excellent to see my boy silco back looks like he was the brains while vander was the brawns behind their operation \n\n really impressed with caits arc many here predicted that darth caitlyn will come up in act  but cait is just acting like herself sure she has grown in power and is stricter sterner but she retains her core moral self also her getup is so cool",
        "obligatory this is kino moment",
        "anyone knows if the name of that jukebox jazzy song at the start of the vander flashback",
        "i just want to say i love the family reunion no matter what happens i just hope they dont split up the sisters again i would never forgive them if something happened to the three of them",
        "jinx called vi fat hands so im happy",
        "the beast came for you he was summoned by you\n\nummm based on what did they come to this conclusion that he had a cut on his hand",
        "their mom sounds just like jinx",
        "removed",
        "jayce looks hot",
        "help whats the name of the song they play on the jukebox i need it on my spotify",

        "that psyops vi skin goes hard",
        "that escalated quickly",
        "better than the tyson paul fight by a mile",
        "dude the reunite w vander honestly almost made me cry",
        "anyone knows the name of the song  which comes when vanders flashback fades and we go back to caves for heartwarming moment of vander and girls shazam google dont know it i dig half spotify of soundtrack playlists please help",
        "would have liked to see connol the father of jinx and vi what a great ep as always vi is a monster with them hands",
        "damn this show is incredible how do they keep on maintaining such a masterful quality to it the story goes in directions you just cannot predict onto episode  who i hear is also brilliant\n\nthe flashback moment was beautiful and vander vi  jinx hugging it out gave me goosebumps",
        "i have never cried while watching a movie tv or reading a book in probably a decade this is the first what a show",
        "did i miss something or am i right to feel that vi was kind of quick to eh accept that hey guess thats my dad now i know shes had a rough couple weeks but damn girl",
        "a bit unrelated to the episode but i just wanna say as long as im alive caitlynn will have at least one hater if she has none then im gone i hope she never gets a redemption arc and meets her maker  im the number one member of caitlynns hate club even tho she was my favourite \n\nofficial apologies to jinx btw",
        "mels brother is alive\n\nactually i dont believe its the real kino",
        "im not crying you are",
        "i think jayce is a decade older when he returns heimer claims itll take at least  years to safeguard hextech against misuse if viktor was able to build his commune to such a degree in a few months imagine what he could do in a decade \n\nalso if this is true it means jayce was reeling over his divorce by himself or with company for waaaay too long",
        "show is going way too fast feel like im skipping episodes",
        "im a damn grown ass man\n\nmy face seems to be leaking",
        "vi  jinx  vander \n\nidgaf abt cait and her bs no more",
        "were silco vander and felicia really just friends it felt like a love triangle to me the not this song comment and the way felicia looked over her shoulder at vander using his name suggestion the care both silco and vander show when she reveals shes pregnant the certainty she has that these two are now on the hook the tension during that entire scene am i crazy",
        "vis new look really reminded me of rhea ripley",
        "can someone explain whats going on",
        "and on the rd day he rose again",
        "how is felicia realted to silco and vander is she a sister or a friend and are vander and silco brothers by blood or close friends\n\nis it a bit weird that neither silco nor vander ever brought up their mother with the two girls since they both knew her closely",
        "whats the reasoning behind how jayce came back was it connected to salo or was it a coincidence that he came back at the same time",
        "probably being dumb but what do they mean by blisters and bedrock",
        "ok this is the best episode the entire series",
        "oh my god we got two different siblings reunited the way the episode is mirroring the two sibling plotsgod they both better end well i swear",
        "i let my guard down from how boring the last episode was only to dry my happy tears away a half hour later well played riot my only tiny complaint is how much more they could have shown vis emo phase felt a little rushed",
        "why did singed stay in prison\n\nwhat did singed need that he got from ambessa what is his backstory that he abandoned his city and what happened to his daughter\n\nwho the hell is jinx and vis father than",
        "i actually want some peoples opinions do you genuinely think vander was in love with felicity",
        "cinder gets that backstory drop",
        "have they released on spotify the music felicia played on the jukebox",
        "riot really tied this vander saga up really well",
        "omg  that explains why silco spent his life taking care of powder",
        "sounds like the mom has the same va as jinx at least to my ears",
        "vi in her korra era",
        "people were mad at cait but id call it leading to vis new look and absolute success\n\nworth the alcoholism and depression",
        "something about vi getting to protect her sister the way she wish he could have before i love this\n\njinx finally being able to fix her family and getting them together",
        "honestly didnt see how they could after everything but it makes sense for vander",
        "i really didnt think this show would go in that direction at all and theyd just become more divided im very happy to be wrong\n\nloving the direction of the story right now caitlyn has always been my fav so hope she vi and jinx can end on good terms\n\nand maddie can fuck off lol",
        "that whole fight was such a sibling thing",
        "jinx dialed up her humor to notch  this episode she went full on league jinx and i loved every second of it \n\nher calling sevika lefty had me rolling lmao",

        "removed",
        "so far i thought vander adopted vi  powder and their mom  dad were killed in some war\n\nalso was their mom sex worker when she said working week to week for living i kind of got that interpretation maybe i am reading way too much into it\n\n\nedit spelling mistake",
        "maybe she just got sent to the third shadow realm",
        "she was in season  as well  gonna miss hee",
        "dude died to a single q",
        "its a shame i liked good guy salo",
        "bro liquified poor salo",
        "seems like he wasnt the guy anymore too perfect perhaps the arcane took humanity away from salo",
        "gold",
        "well he said he was sorry didnt he",
        "zaun finally gets a counselor",
        "reinhardt would be proud",
        "well the show is about to end in  episodes there is not exactly much time left\n\nwhich is kind of wild to me everyone says its good to not drag a show out but there is also such a thing as ending things too soon i just hope the final act of arcane doesnt feel rushed",
        "b\n\nr\n\na\n\nv i n c e\n\no",
        "as someone else mentioned silco probably named powder",
        "when isha runs up to join the  girls",

        "too many questions not enough evidence to come up with decent theories that was my reaction anyways",
        "the whole council thing was the scariest moment for me because i was the most worried for her\n\ni was certain they were going to make us love her and then take her out then and there",
        "were they really just friends it felt a lot like a love triangle to me the not this song comment and the way felicia looked over her shoulder at vander the care both silco and vander have for her when she reveals shes pregnant the tension during that entire scene am i crazy",
        "silco and vander being friends with vi and jinx mother and wanting to build a future for them\n\nyes but am i the only one who reads some of the flashes of vanders memories as suggesting that he himself may have lost control of his rage and been responsible for killing her and her husband during that uprising accidentally i would have to think but still there are definitely some strange images we see and i recall his note to silco saying something about his guilt maybe",
        "is it wrong i thought he looked hotter",

        "hark itself means listen iirc\n\nmy guess is it has some tiein to macbeth or some other shakespearean play given the allusion to macbeth with caitlyn in the intro\n\nidk it feels too hoitytoity fancy hipstery just so riot could let their theater kids show theyre cultured and otherwise kills immersion for a bit it takes you out of the show because its so weird for jinx to say",

        "i was really confused for a sec",
        "jinx was never the one actively fighting vi she was defending and retaliating against enforcers sure but vi was always the one on the chase because she deemed jinx to be a liability as jinx is pretty much a terrorist at this point vi doesnt directly hate jinx but she considers any deaths caused by jinx to be her responsibility\n\nso truly i think jinx doesnt hate vi but she cant trust her neither of them directly hurt one another afaik but with vander they have something that might put the pieces back together",
        "jinx is too unstable shes still mentally a child in a lot of ways thats why she vibes with isha so well\u00a0\n\nso like a kid that says i hate you then turns around and says i love you jinx is not mature enough shoot she was going to forgive vi if she murdered caitlyn like everything forgiven\n\nvander being alive is a good enough catalyst for her\n\nvi knows she has a soft spot for jinx and she cant help but go with her she hadnt forgiven jinx until vander was hugging her i think vander was the balm to heal the wounds",

        "its the song from the first season our love  curtis harding jazmine sullivan",
        "like straight up",
        "theres a scene in episode  of season  when vi is waking up from her stab wound being healed and first sees caitlyn as her mother its very easy to miss because her vision is a bit blurry and the only other time wed seen her before was her dead body briefly",
        "for a minute i thought vis mom was somehow a kiraman",

        "people like you are straight up concerning",
        "yeah it might very well be another form of psychological torture",
        "yeah when i saw vs intro i was like is this a time jump i only watched ep  a week ago i cant remember anything",
        "ive been super confused cause i also felt that tension in this scene but to me it felt like she had an affair with vander and maybe silco was just affectionate towards her totally agree that there was a nonplatonic vibe there though",
        "probably you are crazy it felt like friends being silly with one another having a serious conversation if feeling were there it would be\u00a0inappropriate because she had a partnerhusband i think its weird your mind makes everything sexual for sure",
        "vander will probably get a new head completing the transformation",
        "you see what bugs me about her inclusion is that it feels off as a matter of fact if felicia never existed in terms of being friends with vander and silco then i could digest these scenes better\n\nwhy it looks like felicia and her husband are both some sort of miner not exactly a high paying job why does that matter vi when talking with caitlyn on her bed described having a bed slightly smaller than caitlyns meaning her parents made quite a bit of money nothing similar to zaun but reminiscent of piltovers society i mean you need not look further than how any of how the other under city children live including the latest addition isha proper beds for kids isnt cheap\n\nsecondly if silco was aware and loved felicia even as a friend why would he dishonor her memory by trying to kill her kids specifically vi and especially felicias first born he knew exactly who the kids were but was willing to kill them hell he was ready to kill vi even after learning she survived the explosion and escaped prison\n\nif vi and powder were just two kids that got adopted for the sake of adoption only i think this scene gels better hopefully act  fixes this issue because right now i just think this is really flawed \n\nact  has some beautiful moments dont get me wrong but vi and powders parents are such a glaring issue since it makes a lot of the story beats of season  make silco seem scornful and hateful to even people he loves its out of character for silco seeing as he gives vander a second chance to join him and he honours vanders memory by building a statue of him yet he conveniently forgets about felicias children and wants to kill them yikes character assassination\n\nagain i hope they address this in act",
        "pretty sure it was salo on top of viktor also probably having some power to free him since he was able to put salo inside",
        "theyre just shortening something felicia said",
        "damn i thought jinxwarwick fight was probably my favorite fight in the entire show i dont really think any of the episodes are boring some people say theyre too fast paced others too boring damned if you do damned if you dont i guess",
        "if singed leaves the cell warwick would kill him\n\natm jinx and vi father is just a random npc who died in the bridge fighting the enforcers",

        "how so",
        "i feel like powder was silcos idea for the baby name",
        "also makes it awkward that he tried to kill vi lol",
        "well no does no one remember that he had no contact with powder the whole time she was with vander and that he was gonna kill her and vi and only didnt because he thought vi abandoned her and saw himself in her he did not care about being their goduncle",
        "its a good addition to the lore felt a bit too convenient in season one when he agreed to take her in",

        "yep literally only way it would make sense and the show nailed it im blown away how good this season has been compared to the high bar the first set",

        "yeah this season has felt way too fucking rushed \n\nthere is such a thing as dragging things out and then there is what this season has been doing so far its pretty obvious to me that this show could have gone for at least one more season jinx and vis friendly reunion is yet again one more plot line where ive felt things just happened too quickly the emotional impact of it wasnt there for me because everything happened at the speed of light \n\npersonally ive been feeling somewhat disappointed about this season",

        "its my biggest critique with the series as a whole honestly the time skip between act  and  in season  worked because it was large enough that it was very obviously clear that a large amount of time had passed and act  was clearly just a backstory to the rest of the story being told throughout the rest of the series the one this season didnt work its still unclear just how much time passed between acts character development happened off screen that while i can see how the characters would get there would have been great to see actually happen on screen it really took me out of it for episode  the scene with vander at the end of episode  brought me back in for the rest of the act though still think it was overall very solid but that timeskip i think will be the biggest scar on the series for me unless they really screw up the ending",

        "nah its a weird walk back  the point of the tea party wasnt just the fact that the two sisters bonds were being permanently severed it was how they were being severed despite killing him at the party jinx became the person who definitively carried on silcos will the point was that vi was vanders daughter with all his strengths flaws and beliefs and jinx was silcos the two of them were the repetition of the conflict between the two brothers of the prior generation just brought to even more tragic and violent heights its why the idea that vi saying vander is also jinxes father rings a bithollow because making her just be vanders daughter again and have them all come back together as a family removes the whole big denouement at the end of season  where jinx when choosing to blow up the council headquarters definitively chose to not be powder anymore to not be vanders daughter and vis sister but to be what silco had made her instead to be jinx walking that back and robbing her of that feelsoff",

        "i get that it was intending to be trying to do a cross generation reconciliation  we saw that with the note in the prior scene where they find the note vander wrote to silco the problem with that is that reconciliation does not at all feel earned for anyone like the note vander wrote to silco is a pretty good example of this  my man you literally drowned your brother in toxic waste disfigured him and wouldve killed him if he hadnt grabbed you knife and stabbed you in the arm forcing you to let him go  you didnt stop or show any mercy he had to try to kill you or hed be dead ignoring the fact its also heavily implied that vander betrayed silco as part of his peace deal with piltover the entire notion you can wash away a betrayal that deep and violent with something like ah damn man sorry i just kinda went off the deep end after our adopted sister got gunned down i get you need your time but were still bros you know so when you want to patch things up lets get a few brews at our favorite bar is fucking ridiculous\n\nproceeding to validate that notion where jinx says oh if silco only read this everything would be different is justdumb no it wouldnt have fixed anything  vanders method of reconciliation was categorically wrong and deluded which was always vanders problem he could only see things in his immediate area often blinkered by a kinda positivevibesonly headlights and never acknowledged just how his actions helped destroy not just zaun but also his brother and how he helped shepherd the poisonous effect silco had on zaun in his eyes as long as he could protect vi and jinx for a moment a protection that once he was gone absolutely and utterly failed as we see with how far off the deep end both vi and jinx went he was right which is again just not how things work the point of jinx and vi and silco and vander and even zaun and piltover is sometimes there are things you cant walk back there are some ties that once poisoned stay poisoned its what gave season  a fair amount of dramatic weight because it didnt actually back down from that problem just gave it space to breathe and turned it over in its hands\n\nhaving said that there are ways to do reconciliation which is clearly what they wanted to do but if they wanted to go in that route they a had to have been doing it over at least the entire season  much like it took a full season to remake the bond between vi and power from one of familial love and care into one of vengeance and familial hatred it would take a full season to bring it back to that level and b they needed to have both learned from vander and silcos conflict from the conflict between zaun and piltover  they needed to show not just that one guy was pretty much right the entire time that being the guy who and i cant state this enough was obviously wrong but that both parties had had something to say and that the only way out of the repetitions of violence was finding ways to improve and overcome those conversations to meld them together into something actually stronger than the cycles of revenge they kept finding themselves in but the show didnt do that and in doing so lost a huge amount of the legitimate dramatic weight it had going for it",

        "i dont understand why some people say that the death of a new established character like isha has no emotional weight in season  we only knew vander for  episodes while  of the time the focus was on the piltover characters but now there isnt a single person in this fandom who wouldnt agree with vander being one of their favorites i suspect this impression is based on the fact that isha didnt speak and everything had to work through gestures and facial expressions but i think fortiche nailed that aspect very well\n\ni do agree with the fast pace though but i disagree with calling it poorly written this show relies on the audiences expertise to fill in the gaps in the story and connect or recall certain scenes or lore and that was no different in the first season the  new acts just demand more of that and some people seem to be overwhelmed by it i encourage everyone to give their opinions not based on their personal feelings but rather based on valid arguments and constructive criticism\n\ni like that the writers were very bold from the beginning of season  they could have easily repeated similar story arcs to season  but they decided to go crazy and i respect that and i think it worked quite well yes arcane season  is very different but if you look at it that way and stop comparing the current episodes to what you imagined or wished for youll be able to recognize the vision the writers had and enjoy the beauty of it \ni have faith in the writers that they will give us a worthy conclusion to everything weve seen today and if they are not able to do so i still admire the effort",
        "now what we do with maddie just throw her to the side",
        "dude the buff warriors dude death was brutal\nep got me shaking in my boots ishaaaa",
        "viktor was  void corrupted jayce prevented piltover and zaun from becoming another icathia",
        "lot of talk about jayce understandably the thing is with his flashes of vision he saw something a lot worse than we did the people in the commune barely looked human they were almost voidlike creatures whether those were future flashes seeing past a veil or hallucinations is yet to be seen regardless i think that when we understand jayces perspective his actions will seem a lot more reasonable\n  \ni think viktor was following something he didnt entirely understand i dont think thats sky in his head i think it mirrors the black rose plot with mel where that was not her brother it seems like it may be some sort of hivemind considering the lack of individuality and the collective death",
        "viktors lines were golden all of them i loved that it seemed like he didnt really change he was more with the hexcore not less as i thought \n\nvanders reunion with jinx and vi made me cry the montage when they were kids holy shit omg absolute cinema\n\nishas sacrifice just chills\n\nand even tho i hate what jayce did i can understand him he didnt become a prohpet like viktor he spent who knows how much time in the hexcore in pain  as viktor said of course he thought that what his friend became was nothing but an empty shell or worse a corrupted mind\n\ni highly doubt that viktor is dead tho we saw that he could possess people they were like a hivemind also jayce was unable to destroy the hexcore with his hammer as long as it excist viktor excists as well at least his mind",
        "one thing that im a bit confused about is why cait suddenly joins forces once again with vi i understand maybe she got tired of ambessa and her manipulation but the transition felt somewhat rushed i hope to see more clarification in the next few final episodes otherwise fantastic season so far excellent job to the animators and story team",
        "viktor saw the future no\n\nin the beginning we saw viktors home beeing destroyed and the coin rolls then we see viktor watching from the outside\n\nthe same scene happened at the end we again see viktors destroyed home and the coin rolls\n\nso i believe viktor was seeing the future and did nothing against jayce because he already know what will happen after\n\nedit also viktor knew who was coming to meet him",
        "viktor is definitely not dead \nand that speech about humanity hes going to come back without his humanity and wipe out everything",
        "died \n\nborn \n\nwelcome back\n\ndied \n\nnoooo not my goat vander again",
        "im happy to hate jayce instead of cait we are so back",
        "i bet the end scene of the episode vander actually got destroyed but he will regenerate and become more wolf like taking the apperance of warwick and losing most of his recovered humanity also singed will revive victor",
        "victors ending speech ishas memories flashing as she runs through the battlefield that final finger gun with her eyes swelling up\n\nthe first time i watched this i was literally too overwhelmed to process it today i watched it again and i cried like i have never cried before\n\nthat which inspires us to our greatest good is also the cause of our greatest evil",
        "i shouldve never watched arcane bro",
        "man viktors death fucked me up i actually teared up hes been my  favorite character since s fuck this betrayed by his best friend jayce too\n\n\non the other hand the visuals have been absolutely stunning",
        "what blows my mind is how fast jinx can move in this arc shes dodging warwick and rictus with ease",
        "i think the whole two sides of the same coin symbolism surrounding viktor jayce and the arcane are pretty interesting ive seen people wonder whether jayce or viktor are the ones being manipulatedinfluenced but i think they might both be i think this is what viktor and sky are talking about at the start of the episode two sides of the arcane viktor and jayce selfreplicating and selfannihilating the question i suppose is why does the arcane tap into a bigger conflict or maybe thats just the nature of the arcane it being chaos and having so much energypower means it must have two sides that directly oppose each other\n\nthis idea of two sides is obviously represented and continuously brought up with viktors coin but the colors of the hexcore are also flipped between the one we see jayce getting trapped in and the ones in viktors cosmosspace might be physical representations of those two sides\n\nthat being said viktor and jayce are still very much acting in character viktor is helping the needy as he always intended although as with s he seems to me meddling with things beyond his understanding and jayce is seemingly defending the world so that calls into questions how much exactly of what happened is due to jayce and viktors characters and how much is due to outside interference maybe that also ties into what viktor said about fate maybe the characters simply align with the role that was destined for them \n\nas an aside while jayce definitely found out things he did not know previously i cant help but feel like the people he went into the arcane with werent random nor forgotten i think heimerdinger especially with how opposed he was to the hexcore and ekko might have influenced jayces behaviour and mission either with the time they spent in the arcane or maybe by a similar mechanism to viktor and sky",
        "fuck these creators they made me care they made me believe these characters lives were finally going to be whole again but no this is why we cant have nice things they really couldnt of just given us a nice ending to this episode no they had to make me emotional and depressed now i really hope the little one is just injured and not dead jinx doesnt deserve that type of emotional damage \n\n  \njayce really just committed a genocide with that one blast",
        "well now we know what ella purnell was talking about when she said there was a big thing nobody on reddit predicted\n\nim gonna cry myself to sleep now  fucking red wedding of an episode\n\nedit also just want to say this was the best three episodes of any media ive ever seen\n\nedit  cant sleep  literally just lying here coping  its probably for the best that viktor didnt heal vander  he wouldve become a weird cult member tied to viktors life force and i wouldnt really like that for him",
        "isha vander viktor are all dead",
        "i really dont know how i feel about this act its such a roller coaster\n\nsome things dont add up for me how is ambessa still alive also how cait switched sides was a bit too fast imo \n\nalso  the doctor why did he create vander and then let himself get captured or even go to that rally in addition to letting lose ww he mentioned he was the key to saving his daughter did i miss something\n\n\ni cant wait to see what mel is up to also goddamn jayce",
        "it breaks my heart that ishas life flashing before her eyes showed that she views powder as a parental figure shes an orphan and the time spent with powder may have well been the only time she had a sense of what a home was\n\nand as fast as she got to know an aunt and grandfather a family it all disappears\n\ne saw a comment on youtube that vander and isha deaths will be the last time powder dies and since isha is mute jinx wont be able to hear her voices in her head",
        "all the more painful to realize that jinx not only had to lose vander again but to also lose isha who was essentially one of the few things keeping her grounded and happy in a big sister role\n\nthey were not playing when they said ohhh the misery",
        "watching this episode was a mistake my whole week is ruined now",
        "those last  minutes what the fuck\n\nthe music the narration the fucking montage",
        "i like how they portrayed generational trauma and how history always repeats when jinx watched isha run to try and fix things i imagine she recognised herself when she was younger when powder ruined everything by trying to help isha is a child and she was trying to save her adopted mum from the big baddie but she didnt think about the emotional ramifications she didnt think about herself all she cared about is saving her loved one but sadly it will probably produce a tragic ending",
        "mark my words caitlyn will kill ambessa",
        "so mel is solari a ascendant child im dumb af",
        "no but really where the eff are ekko  heimerdinger",
        "was not expecting caitlin to change sides wheres ekko and heimerdinger",
        "ok im loving this season so far but the pacing is so fast its hard to keep up with and theres like  different stories all going on at once i cant keep anything straight also ugly tears at isha and vanders death jinx is really going through the wringer this season",
        "i think there is a chance that the arcane might be related to the void it seems like it is an infection from another realm and it is spreading like a disease just a thought\n\ngifgiphylhlrnawxxnmhklk",
        "my main question is how are they going to end every storyline in  episodes seems wayy too little to me for a good ending",
        "caitlyn training scene reminded me of blue eye samurai lmao",
        "viktor said the thing greatest show ever",
        "did i miss something or were ekko and heimer not in act  at all what happened to them how did jayce escape but they didnt i hope act  addresses some of this i didnt see them in the preview i was hoping to see ekko reach his league stage but idk if we will at this point",
        "the animation style of this series is fuckin mind blowing the action scenes the slomo fuckin hell i dont think any animation can peak this",
        "stood glued at the front of my screen for the entire  hours what a ride \n\nlike others mentioned i wish i could have seen caitlyn have more angst over vi and their shared memories mmpf",
        "idk about yall but i really liked viktors monologue at the end of episode",
        "jayce what the fuck man surely hes got some genuine reasoning but there could not have been a worse time",
        "no chance jinx ends up not completely mentally fucked after that not going to buy it if shes normal again by episode  at this point she should be tweaking tf out she finally had it together and as soon as she was happy her source of joy just dies",
        "anybody else not okay",
        "rip isha this is gonna leave jinx shattered\n\n spheres in the gun thats a direct parallel to when powder put  of them in the monkey and killed her entire family \n\nthat what inspires us to our greatest good is also the cause of our greatest evil jinx is gonna go full joker\n\njayce what did you see",
        "that montage of all of ishas memories with jinx at the end along with her little pew has me bawling",
        "at least there was one good thing that came from this episode  caitlyn in this scene",
        "three scientists disappear into the void \n\nthe destroyer jayce returns smashing the present and clearing the field\n\nmaybe next comes the preserver ekko collecting all the pieces and stepping back to an earlier time\n\nand the creator heimerdinger assembles the pieces into something new perhaps more hopeful\n\nif jayce ekko and heimerdingers jaunt through the hexcore dimension doesnt lead to something like this i hope it is equally or more resonant\n\nfeels kind of suitable that viktor the herald of an allconsuming oneness would be balanced and opposed by a trinitytriarchtriumviratetrimurti of jayce ekko and heimer individual but working together for a common cause",
        "i can see ishas death resulting in two different scenarios with jinx either she goes completely insane and all of the redeeming that she started to build up this act will be for nothing i think that would be very disappointing path or she will need vi to help her get through this join vi and caitlyn to fight ambessa and use her gift to make things for good cause like viktor told her and vi tells her in the sneak peek and continue her redemption arc",
        "isha wanted to be a big fat hero just like jinx the stupid child",
        "i finished watching act  like hours ago and im still so sad about ishas death like did they really have to kill her off  yall also like jinx always blamed herself for people around her dying and idk how shes gonna react to this butttt the scene did kinda end before we saw isha die so theres still hope cope",
        "can we not let powder stay happy for  minutes just  god damn minutes",
        "internally cried myself to sleep imagining what poor jinx is gonna go through watching the only person she got to love legit suicideblow up herself and her dad \n\nwith the same damn blue stones \n\ntheyre really jinxed jinxs life huh",
        "guys pleeasseee is there any chance of isha being alive",
        "viktor called  jinx powder im depressed\n\nand the kid fucking killed herself im extra depressed",
        "victor quoting socrates during dialog with singed is very nice topping to the show overally\n\n\nreminded me that its not some melodrama for girls",
        "and jayce came in and fucked everything up",
        "did singed inject vander in the end or did vander just go insane because he was also touched by viktor like the followers",
        "where time boi is he safe is he alright",
        "caitlyn x blue eyed samurai",
        "is viktor going to rise from the dead in  days",
        "i love how the flashbacks of vanders are in watercolor traditional media with focus on the subjects being the people in his memory kinda like a melancholic throwback while ishas are in colorful scenes with crayonpencil crayon strokes which is what it was like to see the world with jinx through her eyes\n\n  \nobligatory fuck you jayce why must you be so damn cryptic",
        "there has to be a rewind in time right guys ekko will fix this right right",
        "the pacing is uh not great\n\nalso would have liked a bit more depth to caitlyns switch back to the good guys",
        "damn not only is she a crack shot but caitlyn is pretty good with a bo staff too",
        "do you think vi likes caitlyn cause of her moms hair",
        "this is gonna be a good jinx fight",
        "i loved the episodes but ive been wondering where are ekko and heimerdinger arent they supposed to be with jayce or is there some spacetimething going on with the hexcore that keeps them from reappearing",
        "ekko appearing in the act  yelling at jayce\nhow the fuck did you manage to deal this damage for less than a fucking evening",
        "im not sure what caused vanders enrage but i just wanna share what i think\n\nwith vander being slowly influenced by viktors magic to heal much of that helped vander be more intouch with his human side enough to stand on  legs form sentences and human thoughts\n\nwith viktor killed so did the magic the commune and whatever was healing vander but part of vanders identity as warwick is his regenerative capabilities so when the viktor died the magic not only persists inside vander but was perversed into warwicks psyche physically hurting him from the inside but not dying vander is still in there but whatever was holding him intact is now killing him\n\n  \ni might be wrong maybe theres another reason why vander started spitting out lava but i personally dont so please tell me whats right",
        "this episode managed to make me think for a second the act would have a positive ending curse my optimism",
        "how much time did jayce spend in the magic realm\n\nit looks like months or even more he looks like bum and behaves like one too he even has a leg brace for some reason\n\nby killing viktor he effectively killed at least few dozens of people if not a few hundred the screams were ngl scary",
        "i know hes a bad guy but ambessas right hand man is fuckin bad ass to watch fight haha i love his scenes",
        "reporting heimer and ekko for afk\n\nwarwick hard carrying fr",
        "in the previous episode when singed calls for warwick in the prison he shuts his prison cell door we know in this episode that caitlyn finds him in the prison cell when everyone else escaped with jinx so did singed want himself found by caitlyn  ambessa maybe this was his ploy to get new investors for his experiments now that silco is dead",
        "just gimme a second\n\n\n\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh whyyyyyyyyy\n\nok im good\n\nme and my friends had a watch party last night and it ended with all of us sobbing together \n\nfuck",
        "the scene that starts with vi asking vik to heal vander all the way through the water color animation is an actual masterpiece even if youve never seen the show before those few minutes stand by themselves as perfect television one of the best episodes ive ever watched",
        "the season definitely feels rushed there has been so much that has gone on but doesnt feel explained or explored enough i understand the time commitment and effort it takes to make this show but another six episodes or so wouldve greatly benefited this series pending the finale",
        "alright i think im gonna agree with the people who said the pacing was off this show desperately needed a rd season\n\nstill a solid  though just on vibes animation passion and the fact that im staying past midnight to watch this and probs will do the same next week\n\ni just cant really feel much for isha when ive only known her for like  episodes but man what jayce went through and the animation on vander and the feels round him was greeeeat",
        "fortiche wtf you can not just end it here oh my god this will be the slowest week of my life waiting for act",
        "yo ekko reverse time real quick",
        "honestly hearing that viktors magic is finite could make for a really cool character in league\n\nthe character starts with all skills max lvld and they get stronger as the skills are deskilled the base damage on their abilities is low w high cooldowns ult is  mana gets converted into atk spd at a  ratio mana gets lowered with each lvl autos deal damage based on  of total ap\n\nthe character when an ability is deskilled completely gains permanent atk spd and can go over",
        "god\n\nfucking \n\ndammit\n\ni fucking knew they were gonna kill isha off\n\ngod they just couldnt be happy forever\n\nhonestly fuck you jayce though strangely i dont entirely mean that i still like him and his new look i would fucking despise andessa if it was because of her vander lost his mind but shes so far a clear antagonist unlike jayce where we know hes probably a good person \n\nlike i do love the fact that it wasnt andessa who screwed over the colony an unseen third party throwing a wrench on the plans keeps things interesting",
        "i was predicting that viktor would survive till the end of the show after their world would be nearly destroyed from the arcane or just war by itself and that it would be revealed that he actually traveled back in time to save jayce and his mother in that blizzard scene in the first season delivering the wild rune and trying to refresh their timeline or some weird preditable shizzo idk hes dead now so",
        "cant believe i let them do this to me again quit blowing all the cute kids up",
        "jinx  machine herald\n\ngifgiphykdblrovbpoyklbmqx",
        "jayce needs to explain himself asap",
        "damn viktors arc ended sooner than i thought it would rip",
        "act  is peak for me \n\ni cant predict all the plot that happens in act  honestly and im glad they make act  the way it is we got so many peak scenes and story telling",
        "about caitlyn and vi\nso when vi follows singed she gets caught by caitlyn on the way and then they decide to fake arrest her so she can be alone with ambessa then trap her on a net and then what go away and let her escape anyway\nit not like that was an necessary escape plan she was only there because caitlyn helped with the plan in the first place did i miss something or did that sequence of events mean literally nothing other that to show caitlyn has betrayed ambessa",
        "what were  those robots that jayce saw in the commune is he being ripped between dimensions also ishas flashbacks were so cute drawn with crayon",
        "i cant tell if caitlyn and vi are together again and if so what the hell was the point of having her hooking up with maddie lol\n\ni have to say as much as i am digging the overall plot and i loved this episode and the ending a lot of the character development and relationships feel rushed we know caitlyn would miss vi and has lots of reasons to distrust ambessa but without actually seeing her deal with those feelings it feels like i have to meet them more than halfway i felt similarly about jinx and vis reconciliation obviously we can fill in the gaps but i think it would have been stronger if we dont have to",
        "cait shrugging as if to say well you asked me to after she claps vi across the chin with the gun and vis face when she initiates it it was almost seductive lol\ni love them",
        "glad to see im not the only one who thinks this is bordering near misery porn",
        "caitlyns character arc would be absolute disappointment if this is the end of her redemption i hope not",
        "okay what made caitlyn betray ambessa i understand that shes trying to help vi but did she find out that ambessa was manipulating her the entire time i didnt understand it from the character standpoint or i dont know if i missed something",
        "is there any reason why the song at the end was in chinese lmao im literally part chinese myself but it was just so jarring and out of place it took me out of the moment",
        "not enough people are talking about the watercolor montage that shit had me sobbing it was so beautiful and sad",
        "jayce ruined everything vi was finally happy",
        "i can see the inspiration for vander riot has drawn from beast in xmen",
        "isha nooooooo please",
        "how does riot games the game studio that madeleague of legends of all things create one of the most beautiful pieces of art ever created wtf",
        "so you see im off to rewatch the entire three episodes again right away",
        "isha saves jinx with her gun paying her back from the time she saved her from the goons peak fiction",
        "fuck hextech",
        "this is literally the best goddamn series ever legit crying at the end",
        "arcane is emotional torture lol  fuck",
        "so far i think arcane should not have  seasons season  needed  acts maybe act  will slow down a bit because pacing is literally my only critique",
        "fed jayce one shots weak viktor with eq combo",
        "im devastated",
        "jinx is one of the most tragic characters i have ever seen even before this act but now its been taken to a whole new level i cant imagine how this will effect her in act iii",
        "so jinx is back to being bad after this ep right",
        "i honestly think isha didnt die \n\nthis might just be wishful thinking but at the last second or two before the big explosion scene faded to black after she shot jinxs gun time completely froze which could be a sign of ekko appearing using his zero drive in episode  to undo all of it",
        "spoilers  \n  \ndoes anyone feel like wild arcane runes and viktors cult took heavy inspiration from the movie annihilation  i cant help but notice the similarities in the movies shimmer dome and the iridescent colouring of his followers and him moreover viktors death scene eerily resembles the light house setting of annihilation both of these seem to have a unnatural almost twisted vibes like something is messing with the natural world in a way that should not happen jayce definitely saw something horrible",
        "i just want a caitvi happy ending is that so much to ask",
        "i dont see nearly enough people none in fact questioning what that lava like substance was that was bleeding out of warwick when he went fire fang mode at the end of act  no way its just literal lava probably a standin also whatever it is i also wanna know why singe decided to design warwick with it idk much lol lore but im relatively caught up with arcane",
        "i dont give a fuck why everyone talks about season two is worse than first one jeez its the most epical conversation between the interests ive ever seen in the animation series i repeat ever seen arcane and especially in this episode shows us not hard thoughts to exploration about but it still shows us important things that fills our lives in all jeez that was so hurtful to watch on the conflict between best friends who by the fact actually started all those whole situation with the hextech and war between zaun and peltover this series is just literally increasing the degree of action in each new fucking episode and it doing it so hot and proper that i couldnt even criticize it just cheers for riot and forsche they made a fucking majestic just wonderfull work just cheers im all",
        "no not isha i will not forgive this",
        "it was pointed out to me via a comment on youtube and now i cant unsee it when vi spits at caitlin caitlin wipes the spit over her mouth shes still thirsty haha",
        "ambessas th trait was sacrifice exactly what isha did",
        "matilda fans we are back  i aint doubt her for a second rip to isha though i cried for like  mins watching that scene for her and for jinx",
        "ive noticed this only now but i think isha stole the hextech core from vis gauntlet before entering viktors city if you watch closely you can see her slip something in her bag",
        "lava in your veins\n\nreminds me of \n\nblood in their veins",
        "the scar this act has left me lays deep in me losing vander again as well as the little child this is a perfect mix for the chaos to come",
        "lets gooooo get him jayce",
        "that final music with isha and the flashbacks i just cant so much emotion cried so much why",
        "okay so what can we deduce from the original season  trailer i remember seeing a clip of all of those people who had those weird gold marking from victor and theyre all flying up in the sky which hasnt happened yet so victor will come back somehow and heal everyone and i think he can also heal vanderwarwick\n\nplease god vander deserves some kind of happy ending pleasseeeee",
        "ok i maybe dumb but i dont understand why jayce did all that  he said hextech is a curse but then didnt he like shoot with the hextech thing  or am i missing sumn",
        "also omgggg the act  previewweee cait n vi angst n then they make out omggg im already seatedddd",
        "ok yeah vander was lost but what was the point of stopping him when they still had the army to fight",
        "also everyone is saying that jayce did what he did cause he knew what would happen if he didnt killed viktor\n\nbut in the teaser we see and we know that viktor is alive so what was the fucking point",
        "i really want an emmy for caitlyn spitted in the face by vi and still stay in her role of angry ex to mislead ambessa just wow i couldnt do that",
        "it hit when jinx was like my life lately was blurry and clear because of isha isha kept her sane and we could really see a more calm jinx",
        "jayce  murderizes viktor kills a bunch of hextech cultists destroys a family causes chaos that ends in all out war and gets a kid killed\n\nme  yo lets hear his side of the story first before passing judgement\n\nviktor wont be dead though  ambessa and singed will find his body and possibly bring him back to life and use himhis body to control all his former followers like some kind of zombie army  they also got warwick again \n\npiltoverzaun need ekko and the hiemerdonger to get their asses back here to help fight this shit",
        "so im guessing victor and jayce have  opposite sides of the arcane working through them  jayce  seems to be being manipulated by his but i dn if victor was good i mean he seemed a good man in the end wanting to help vander despite the risks but no clue as i thought he was sus as hell",
        "can someone explain what victors coin was from they showed it alot i know its some kind of metaphor i just dont pick on what and where its from exactly",
        "did vanderwarwick go crazy at the end because singed used his device on him or because viktor died",
        "warwickvanders face right before the explosion he was on a rampage but his expression was pure terror that was heartbreaking",
        "just came here to say the end of this episode is the first time i teared up to r a show in a long time i really wish netflix would have done more investment in this series",
        "do you think viktor could come back as machine herald jinx called him machine herald in this episode and it could possibly be foreshadowing but what do you think",
        "deleted",
        "fucking hell these  episodes were insane surprised they managed to write so many different things together but also worry a bit it might complicate the plot\n\nwe have  episodes left and we still need to see heimerdinger come out and become the canon loving maniac he is as well as see ekko get his time abilities somehow\n\nas for jayce i really hope this is some kind of it had to be done for the greater good kind of thing like yeah viktor might have been healing those people but something horrible could have happened if he continued otherwise jayce is going to be hated for life hell still confused about why he wants to kill it so badly what did he see that has him so spooked",
        "i just want everyone to be happy instead i get this neverending pain and suffering tt",
        "when ambessa threw her spear into the ground it reminded me of the roman tradition of throwing a spear into enemy ground to formally declare war",
        "it was so great to see vi reconnect with caitlyn and jinx and just have them be on the same team is so jarring",
        "well i just cried like a baby at the end of that episode",
        "the way this is going i can only see it ending one way and im not sure if the community will like it i highly doubt they just kill viktor and what im actually expecting to happen is ekko will live up to his boy savior title and use his time powers to fix everything it would line up with all the foreshadowing in stuff like the intro where ekko is the only one who jumps over his thread of fate unlike all the others time powers generally get a bit crazy though and theyre gonna have a hell of a time trying to write his powers in in a way that ties everything together while still feeling earned and not like a cheap asspull",
        "what the fuck did i just watch",
        "dawg what did jayce see in the hextech orb to go that insane my guy hated violence in the first season and now he literally committed genocide",
        "jayce is poison for the young",
        "jayce is krombopoulous michael he just loves killing",
        "jayce killed victor killing the entire fucking commune which ends up with isha sacrificing herself and vander",

        "i fucking came here to say this word for word",
        "i was almost waiting for him to say we are truely in a league of legends now",
        "he sounded just like game viktor then as well",
        "from the second she was introduced i kind of guessed it but man i hate being right this time",
        "she was such a cool little eel \n\no",
        "especially with how jinx saw herself in her",
        "im genuinely devastated and actually in denial of a characters death for the first time ever please please god i have one wish it is to let isha live",
        "thats two likable characters from different shows dead for me this week",
        "ekko and heimerdinger is the real savior please save us in act",

        "right i absolutely love how they weave so many different art styles together so seamlessly",
        "and the music  \n  \nholy fuck it feels like a twist of the knife to go along with the visuals",
        "you can truly tell the artists are very passionate it just screams through the screen i love when art is made to please the artists and not the audience\n\nso many parts of this show could be made into wallpapers and music videos its so rare to see something that looks this good and actually is amazing on its own too\n\nill def pay attention to all their future projects by far my fav animated piece of work ive ever seen its so unique and full of feeling",
        "please dont",
        "needs to reboot the router",
        "lmaooo imagine the windows unplug sound for when the zombies fall to the ground\n\nand imagine the windows shut down sfx when salo died",
        "yeah im expecting a days of future past situation here with jayce as the one sent back to prevent a horrible future",
        "jayce is  for sure the good guy here just had some downright atrocious timing",
        "we saw the tree in episode  before the meeting at vander statue scar ekko nd in command who most likely is in charge looks up at mural and you can see it was still alive but looked worse for wear it lost like  of the leaves",
        "at the start of the episode viktor says that isnt jayce there is another will within him  a voice selfreplicating and selfannihilating all the visuals respond to show that viktor is actually describing himself viktor as a character is almost completely subsumed by this drive to create a massive selfreplicating viruslike hivemind it seems like the arcane is literally infecting the world and viktor is was the disease vector spreading it viktor still has his own motivations his own beneficent goals but could he actually stop it if he wanted to if he realised he wasnt healing but infecting\n\nnow im obviously rooting for tin man fortune cookie jesus but probably worth acknowledging theres plenty of good reasons to wipe out an infection like that before it spreads",
        "id be shocked if its revealed jayce is in the wrong here it seems pretty likely hes got some pretty valid justification for doing what hes doing",
        "a theory ive considered is ekko the boy who broke time went and sent jayce back in time to stop the arcane from spreading for the future is horrible but hey well see",
        "i cant begin to express my frustration despite it having good reasons that the show only gets two seasons so much has been compressed or cut out you can just tell",
        "wow fuck you in particular that is glorious",

        "he is probably not dead but idk if he will be viktor either",
        "i agree the healed people and viktor gave me the vibe that they were hella brainwashed and i didnt want that fate for vandar even though hes gone rabid again",
        "like legit the healing treat addiction and damage cause of shimmer by essentially linking your life to viktor  side effects of making you kinda believe he is god hardly a good deal",
        "time and time again in this show we have seen character reject peaceful option and choose violence\n\nvander tried to kill silco and pushed him on his drug kingpin path\n\npowder chose to use hexcrystals in her bomb and caused the death of vanders and the other orphans\n\njinx chose to kill silco\n\njayce and mel tried to pass a peaceful recognition of zaun sovereignty to end the war but again jinx chose violence by ulting and kill half the council\n\nwhy would assume this time violence was the answer that jayce must be right the show keep showing us that violence is not the answer it only breed more violence\n\ntheres only one main character who has never caused harm to anyone and thats viktor but now viktors dream of peaceful healing has been destroyed by jayce and will be twisted into the glorious evolution we know from league viktor will seek to replace flesh by metal and remove emotion from the equation because we keep making the same damn mistake of hurting one another because we ourselves got hurt",
        "vi should have finished ambessa off in the tent \n\nalso i dont think caitlyn was ever fully brainwashed by her",
        "all it took was one cupcake",

        "could happen to any of us really",

        "it feels pretty unequivocal jayce did the right thing\n\nin fact when viktor kept mentioning that voice he believes was compelling jayce it felt like a bit of projection almost as if hed finally heard what was whispering insde of his head",
        "i mean its pretty obvious jayce is trying to do the right thing and the narrative for the show has jayce looking unhinged and suffering from hallucinations and visions in order to make the actions he takes look far more greyer than it may actually be\n\nevents in arc  will vindicate him in the end or at least provide a shitload of context",

        "its clear that shes been conflicted with working with ambessa from the beginning from all the times where shes questioned her usage of violence and all that so imo it wasnt too sudden",
        "she directly experienced parent loss herself if it helps at all",

        "im really curious what he sees if you look at his design it looks like he is surviving somewhere dangerous like his feet have some kind of plate or support and his shoulder is padded with steel",
        "he merked viktor to fix the timeline they are simply in the worst possible timeline hence why jayce is saying i wont fail viktor was too interlinked with the corrupted hexcore preventing ekko from turning back the clock i am coping viktor is probably dead in some fashion and jayce will have unfixable issues",
        "seriously one of the coolest characters\n\nambessa straight up lost her shit after that shes going to be incredibly unhinged now",

        "im very much a fan of waiting until everything is out  but yeah first off the entire time i was watching episodes  i was wondering how the hell theyre going to wrap everything up in another  episodes and secondly it was a ton of whiplash especially with vi and cait i guess we can infer that enough time has passed since they went their separate ways for tensions to cool off but still caits whole character this season has been wild its not terrible just not terribly cohesive lol imho \n\ni just wonder if some stuff needed to be cut or if the needed to do more episodes instead of  im not a lol fan so idk whats up with all this black rose stuff im assuming they kept it in because ambessa is so important and shes going to be a champion and all but still its just been very distracting very curious to see how in gods name they wrap everything up in  episodes though",
        "the fanart will be a glorious evolution of memery",

        "this seems like such a good theory that in destroying this version of viktor he created the possible future he saw\n\n  \nf fuck jayce",
        "could easily be a  paradox like jayce returning to kill viktor is what actually pushes viktor in the direction that results in the future jayce has seen",
        "the flashes jayce sees look like what would be the endpoint of viktors glorious evolution with every cured person turned into an allmachine cyborg with void eyes \n\nwell probably have a situation where he tried to kill viktor to prevent that from happening but ends up being the reason it happens",
        "to be fair normal cults dont have actual healers who can heal incurable diseases",
        "tbf irl cults cant cure diseases",
        "in their defence they actually had a god living among them",
        "i bawled my eyes out fr isha was healing jinxs inner child isha showed vi that jinx is still a caring loving sister isha meant everything to jinx she went through hell to keep her safe",
        "yeah im surprised that so may people agreed that the writers managed to the rich history of two character in  minutes in the jinx vs ekko fight but somehow find it impossible to emotionally connect with the child that brought what was left of powder back just because she didnt have a full season to herself",
        "for one caitlyn made it abundantly clear from the start that she was never particularly on board with ambessas approach caitlyn was forced into the dictator role she didnt seek it out and caitlyn herself mentioned she was only in it to catch jinx once warwick broke loose caitlyn realized that everything she had done since imposing martial law amounted to nothingeven less order was being maintained than before even more enforcers were dying and they were even further from catching jinx with jinx being martyrized and protected by zaunites so at that point her sole reason to continue working with ambessa was to hunt warwick down\n\nbut then she figured out that ambessa was only going to use warwick as a weapon and ambessa was going to work with singed the war criminal scientist thats behind like most of the terrible shit thats happened so when she met up with vi again and found out that the beast she was hunting down was vis father she realized that instead of working with ambessa to hunt warwick down and hand over this living weapon to a warlord and a mad scientist she could instead just work with viviktor and fix vander instead so that was the last reason for working with ambessa gone and she swapped sides\n\nalso caitlyn probably wanted any excuse to get back with vi tbh",
        "she was injected with shimmer in s",
        "all i could think about was that it was all jayce fault in the beginning with the gemstones and stuff and even now",
        "ambessa fucked a solari it seems that seems the most likely case",
        "well it is possible however i really liked the comment from someone the parallels between vi in s and jinx in s are very similar in s im pretty sure when vi lost powder again after the firelights kidnapped her after the blue torch scene caitlyn told her to use all that anger for good\n\nin this season i feel like jinx is acting like the more mature sister after she got to experience what it is like to have a younger sister now that she lost her i can imagine her going crazy for at least one episode but in the teaser we hear vi talking to her and saying that if she uses all that explosive potential for good they can rewrite her story and in the official trailer we heard ekko tell someone sometimes taking a step forward means leaving a few things behind i can see jinx completing her redemption arc and becoming more like an antihero for the story in general but a hero for zaun",
        "i think it was because viktor died caitlyn stopped singed and if he injected him he probably would have reacted sooner than that victors magic seems to have a metal component so i assumed the molten metal was a result of the failed magic being rejected by his enhanced body",
        "last frame froze maybe ekko ulted",
        "i would argue she was never not a good guy but she went to far to get justice for her mother",
        "while im overjoyed for caitlyn to be back to being herself again i equally wouldve wished for a bit more depth to her return to her sense beyond just really missing vi and more realizing the consequences of her actions",
        "if you replay the scene it seems likely singed managed to recover from being restrained \u00a0he then \u00a0used his device to inject vander as cait was distracted by the death of the commune rather than keeping him restrained",
        "yes it was exactly that it was a product demonstration for singed to get to merderda",
        "feels like there is an episode missing between  and   and  i think had great pacing and then theyve rushed things to get a big finale at the end of the arc people like the  episodes per week schedule but having an epic momentshowdown every  episodes might be hurting the pacing i expect them backtracking a bit on jayce stuff in the next episodes and covering it in more detail for how monumental his actions were he needed to have more screen time",
        "only known her for two episodes and shes had like  near death encounters",
        "he aint dead he has to come back as a crazy robot man who makes robots for the purpose of glorious evolution",
        "well this version of viktors arc ended hes basically an omniscient being connected to the arcane beyond the physical i think jaycess wreckitralph routine failed again and well see viktor reborn a second time",
        "is this it seeing vi was all it took im all for caitvi but this isnt at all what i was expecting",
        "the preview doesnt suggest its the end and that vi still holds caitlyn to account",
        "is everyone forgeting that ambessa recruited singed the dude who created shimmer which is what started this entire crazy story i dont think cait is a great fan of that and she was clearly not really brainwashed since she is somewhat antagonistic to ambessa ideas a lot specially thanks to maddie it seems",
        "vi finding her long dead father caitlyn surely must relate to that out of anything in the world",
        "they planted the seed in episode  when ambessa walks in on caitlyn and maddie caitlyn says why is peace always the justification for violence and the blade cuts both ways\n\n i have very mixed feelings about this being the primary justification for caitlyn turning on ambessa especially given her behavior and dialogue in act  but it is what it is a creative imagination isnt required to see how the storys ambitions are undercut by seasonepisode count and while im grateful for what we have i wish we could have had more",
        "big same lol my boyfriend had to ruin my immersion by asking if it was in chinese midscene",
        "it was a false happiness that healing is sus jayce is clearly on a missionwhat you see as good seems horrifying to him hextech is a curse i hope we see what he went through during his trip into the arcane",
        "bro are you watching on like x speed or something you commented this an hour after act  dropped with  minute episodes and what you commented on was near the end of episode",
        "jayce probably has learn somethings in his little reality warping  adventures and know viktors healing would have a very ugly sides latter  i feels like",
        "if you rewatch the scenes with viktor in vanders mind you can see a lot of lava elements in the animation like it honestly looks like hell i missed it my first watch but its there\n\nno clue how it just randomly forms on his body though lmao",
        "yeah she was looking at her gauntlets when vi took them off at the entrance",
        "this is what i was unsure about too if you look at vanderwarwicks head just before it looks like he has those markings on his head that victors other followers have so victor must of partially converted him however during the scene there is a shot of singed standing where warwick went berserk so hard to know for sure imo",
        "i saw an interesting theory that after his death he is revived but he loses his hextech powers and in the future turns himself into the machine herald in an attempt to regain his old powers but im not sure especially because there have been rumors of a viktor vgu for league i think he will certainly back not as his usual self but not exactly in the form that we know from league",
        "oh boy here i go killing again",
        "evolution",
        "i was convinced that they wouldnt actually kill the kid  \n  \ni have to apologize riot i was not familiar with your game",
        "she also said isha reminded her of vi",
        "the reason isha put herself in that situation is because she idolized jinx and jinx took her under her wing and now ishas dead if we thought jinx thought she was a jinx before",
        "ekko can potentially fix all of this with his zero drive \n\nits extremely wishful thinking but he is literally our only hope now",
        "you know i couldnt have done any of this shit without you right you did good kid",
        "theory i came up with\n\nthree scientists disappear into the void\n\nthe destroyer jayce returns smashing the present and clearing the field\n\nmaybe next comes the preserver ekko collecting all the pieces and stepping back to an earlier time\n\nand the creator heimerdinger assembles the pieces into something new perhaps more hopeful\n\nif jayce ekko and heimerdingers jaunt through the hexcore dimension doesnt lead to something like this i hope it is equally or more resonant\n\nfeels kind of suitable that viktor the herald of an allconsuming oneness would be balanced and opposed by a trinitytriarchtriumviratetrimurti of jayce ekko and heimer individual but working together for a common cause",
        "i do too why did he say what have we done at the end of the last arc did he see something that made him regret not going through on his promise to destroy the hexcore also theres gotta be a tiein to se when hes rescued by a victor looking hooded stranger as a kid",
        "i do too everytime jayce came up on screen i was yelling what the hell happened to you guys and holy shit why do you look like that followed by damn keep looking like that man got a glow up fr he pulls off the gritty scruffy look very well while hes not tripping out over the worse hextech high ever i guess",
        "the charcoal moment in ep  was so beautiful the artists really know how to use different mediums for different emotional hits\n\ncharcoal for sorrow water paint for nostalgia d for action amazingly talented people\n\nim merely a texture artist but would be a dream to be involved in something like this i feel like this show has forever impacted how i view art",
        "bringing back that song from season  when warwick goes crazy was perfect its the same song that plays in se of vanders last stand which is just so fucking fitting",

        "the good guy is not a phrase i would use to describe anyone on the show everyone has their good side and their bad side their biases and their flaws the best weve seen from anyone is setting out to pave the road to hell with good intentions",
        "i think part of the reason for me is that this show is literally so amazing in every other quality that i wish it was longer not only would it help the pacing but i just selfishly dont want to say goodbye to these characters after next week",
        "glorious",
        "super thrilled i got exactly  seconds of vander being a father again before getting blown to pieces by his surrogate grandchild \n\ni love this show for all the wrong reasons",

        "get ready for old testament viktor",
        "hes probably gonna be viktor from league from now on",
        "i dont think hes been viktor at all this season like vanderwick hes halfway between his human self and his monster self in this case the machine herald a tool of the hexcore \n\nhes been out of touch with his own body and emotions ever since waking up since then the hexcore through visions of sky is leading viktor by playing on his human compassion to help but notice that everything it leads viktor to do is also helping it grow \n\nthe notable bit is what salo was doing before jayce murdered him because it was still murder jayce salo was stealing hextech from the tower remember that this is ruining ekkos tree and the hexcore is telling viktor to use even more of the stuff \n\nas viktor or is it the machine herald here said evolution is not part of nature its superseding it the hexcore is inherently opposed to everything that ekko and the firelights tried to build for a living community because what it wants is fundamentally inhuman \n\nwith this final death it seems to have succeeded in stripping that last humanity from viktor",
        "i noticed something if you capture the frame where jayce looks at salo and other healed people you get a creepy figure in a mask with the  gold fingers of viktor highlighted loss of identity and hivemind coded indeed",
        "i also still dont trust the sky in viktors mind whatsoever it reads to me entirely like the arcane using an avatar of someone important to viktor to make him do what it wants",

        "it makes more sense that jinx will go after vander than vi she knows vi is strong and can withstand a small cut while vander is losing his mind again even vi would do the same this is their father who died and got back again",
        "this is jayces biggest flaw he often gets idea assumes it is the right one and then charges forward without consulting others or considering alternatives here are some examples\n\norders the bridges between piltover and zaun closed this escalates tensions and frankly wouldnt do anything as jinx would have crossed the border if she wanted to\n\nagrees to shut down silcos drug operation with vi seemingly without consulting the rest of the council this results in a child dying and escalating tensions\n\nmaking a peace deal with silco again without consulting with the council arguably if someone like mel had been handling negotiations a deal could have been reached that silco would actually agree to and wouldnt have set jinx off\n\nfusing viktor with the hexcore i will admit he was panicking but this didnt turn out well\n\ntouching and later smashing the big wild rune thingy smashing it may have been the right call i dont know but it is a decision he unilaterally made \n\ngoing to the commune and blasting viktor he may or may not have been justified but we dont see him seeking out caitlyn or mel assuming he doesnt know she is gone who could have told him what was happening in the city instead he just goes in blasting \n\n\ni dont think all of these were even bad moves but it does show a clear thought pattern to jayce he seems what he considers a problem and he tries to fix it in the way he deems best often without seeking out other opinions",
        "well i hope it sticks the landing to a good extent atleast \n\nif they ever make another show with fortiche i hope they plan for more than  seasons",
        "even these  episodes took  years so might have been tough to do more regardless",

        "after the way season  destroyed me it was the free space on mine",
        "it was such a good parallel to se she made her own monkey bomb just like powder did but isha got it right \n\nshe really did save everyone at the expense of her own life",
        "salo meeting viktor is completely unnecessary for  reasons \n\n we already saw viktors whole messianic healing process showing it again does nothing for the storyline as weve already seen it  it dampens the wonder  shock of the commune that viktor has built since there already was a time skip and it wouldnt make much sense if viktors commune was in its infancy when salo goes there that would mean that the first time we see the commune itd be bustling like it was in the show and then nothing really happens until what happens in the show happens",
        "or just prioritizing differently did we need another scene between salo and the drug girl or could we have had a salo victor scene instead where he mentions he got the tip from the drug girl",
        "i am absolutely hating the over reliance the show has for montages montages for absolutely everything they needed time one more  episode arc more time per episode they said they didnt need to worry about making things like other studios but then rush through the story its soured me a bit on the episodes so far",
        "im confident its gonna end as a damn  out of   \n  \nbut it does feel weird that we only have  episodes left and we dont know nothing of ekko heimer mel we also dont know what jayce went through  \n  \ni am really hoping that if they dont finish mels story at least it leads up to a full black rose show or movie cause it did look really good",
        "also kind of an idiot know you want hextech weapons but antagonizing every surviving hextech engineer is just begging to become a test dummy for said weapons",
        "on the one hand i think time travel cheapens events on the other if it brings back isha and lets jinx have a modicum of peace i will be happy for a time travel plot",
        "two things can be true\n\nthe human part of viktor that remains thinks he is healing people and honestly wants to do what is right\n\nand whatever is actually controlling viktor no way in hell that is actually skys consciousness is using him to fulfill its own goals whatever that may be",
        "i dont think even viktor realises fully what he is doing the apparition of sky could very easily be manipulating him by looking like a friendly face\n\njayce is able to see them as something completely alien to normal humans so there is definitelt something more going on",
        "its considerate that her opponents dont go after her meat arm anymore",

        "and he has that magical core embedded in his wrist",
        "the contrast between your panicked question and reasonable response was funny",
        "yeah i feel like the first season was paced pretty expertly because it focused way more on character beats and development this season it feels like plot point after plot point with everyone kinda fucking off and doing their own thing granted the season is still better than  of shows out there but it feels noticeably rushed compared to season  perfection \n\ncombine that with the short introduction of some new characters isha maddie vis enforcer friend we dont even know the name of and i found it really difficult to care about the new characters i really appreciated the fleshing out of existing characters  vander silco and felicia for example  but the new characters didnt feel as compelling to me",
        "ya know if someone could fix a man who cant walk by touching him i would get it",
        "yeah this set of episodes made it clear that despite her moments of weakness last week she never left the side of the angels seems like she was using ambessa about as much as ambessa was using her",
        "it gonna be selffullfiling prophecy moment i guess jayce saw some glimpse of the future where viktor goes bad with wild runes and army of hive mind zombies so he tried to stop it by killing viktor but all he did was to trigger this events to happen cauze viktor now realised that human is the weak link and he needs to controll them",
        "hopefully jayce is right",
        "the way everyone died after viktor and how he spoke through salo really gave those vibes  \n  \nits not healing it looked more like some sort of brain controlling hive mind",
        "thought the same thing i watched these episodes in order at normal pace as soon as it came out\n\nmaybe people are fastforwardingskipping scenes\n\nedit they just watched the leaks",
        "embrace progress",
        "i would have thought the same but they did kill milo and clagger off in season  somewhat suddenly ishas death cuts differently though because shes so smol and innocent",
        "having the kid to choose to sacrifice itself was def more metal than i expected ngl i was maybe expecting it to be like collateral damage in a bigger conflict\n\nthat shit was full send",
        "i love how this is so similar to the hindu mythology destroyer preserver and creator\n\nand i like how its the scientists that are closest to magic \n\nso curious",
        "i thought it was pretty well implied that jayceheimerdingerekko found out that the hexcore is a unnatural force that needs to be destroyed they saw corruption in the tree and tracked it to the core to find something horrible original viktor was adamant on destroying the hexcore\n\nso its only natural that jayce is on the correct side here in ripping apart this illusion that viktor has fallen into where he can use this force to change the world many comments seem to think jayce is the corrupted one here",
        "no you cant really say that his hair grew out and he has a long beard and he looks rough as fuck because of all the horrible experience he was dealing with but he doesnt actually look much older outside of the hair growth and exhaustion",
        "i think its an extremely bold decision from riot to just abandon these characters and move on to making another show the characters are what people watch this show for not the ip it trended heavily in season  because of a combination of the music art and characters the characters kept people hooked for this season im not sure theyll be able to capture that lightning in a bottle launch for another show even though i know ill be watching it",
        "jayce oh do me give me a tag line\n\njinx the child killer\n\njayce okay i dont like this game anymore",
        "thanks ambessa",
        "there have been so many viktorjesus parallels that im halfexpecting viktor to revive after  days albeit this would be too onthenose\n\njust to list a few parallels for fun  \n healed the downtrodden using miracles  \n gained followers for his noble cause  \n literally just looks like how jesus is often depicted  \n was killed by being pierced while being suspended high up",
        "he only gave a speech about how all emotions good and bad are the cause of all of humanities woes at the end\n\nim sure itll go nowhere",
        "but what happens if its the other way around we know nothing of the situation and viktor himself said that there was another voice inside of jayce i am not saying he is in the wrong but how do we know for sure that jayce isnt the one being manipulated",
        "when cait said why is peace always the justification for violence it seemed very clear that she never bought into ambessas rhetoric the rest of her appearances were very neutral mostly gathering intel working with singed and surveying the situation",
        "its a good point i suppose but i also dont get what singed is even doing outside his lab i guess he was just curious about greater world events and why did he turn vander into a wolf tank the way he saved jinx seemed much more subtle hmm maybe the wolf tank part was silcos idea he wanted to turn the fox back into a literal wolf\n\nand now that silcos gone singed is running out of funding for his experiments which makes him want to trust ambessa maybe he once trusted silco in the same way and that led down a fruitful path\n\nambessa is actually giving singed everything that he wants she represents a new silco for him he has no need to play games with her because she has already proposed exactly the kind of partnership he needs he shows her his secret to just tell her that but then he shouldnt tell her that hes close to a breakthrough once hes resurrected her daughter he no longer has any particular interest in helping her but maybe just by bearing his throat like that he tells her he can be trusted regardless\n\nalso maybe seeing singeds love for his daughter is what ultimately inspired silco to accept his fatherly role towards jinx\n\nedit did singed puprosefully stay behind in prison so that he could talk to the powerful people that he had now gotten the attention from that cant be the thing right why did he stay did he know about ambessa before hand",
        "jinx also knows what its like to loose your mind",
        "if all you have is a hammer",
        "off the top of my head i wish they developed the avengers that cait assembled instead of just throwing them together and having a montage of them gassing the undercity\ni wish we got time to see each of their characters especially the silent blue guy i really like his character design lol because it seemed like their was stuff there just skipped over like shield dude seemed disappointed in cait when she took over but they dont explore that and then hes just in the vi boxing montage\n\nin season  there was an intro music video with the firelights one episode but it was just a cool intro not trying to squeeze a bunch of story into a minute it seems like season  is trying to do that intro music video thing again but multiple times and using it as a storytelling device and it just isnt working",
        "i dont think it has a goal it feels like a force of nature that simply presents itself as viktor wants it to whether he realises it or not funny considering what viktor said prior about nature",
        "hitting the metal arm is a guaranteed crit theyre just playing the mechanic",
        "real jaycers only need a moment of hesitation before they realize the morality of all his actions",
        "act  will definitely give us the jayce perspective",
        "and earlier the way the core shocked viktor when he tried to turn against it controlling him its been bad vibes from the start",
        "they likely watched the leaks of the first  episodes that came out awhile ago and just skipped to episode  lol",
        "pave the way",
        "plus jayce killed a kid last season",
        "ambessa did say the fourth measure of noxian strength was sacrifice",
        "i think its just a matter of how much time and money has to go into developing each season making arcane fans wait another  years for the ending of this story is a heavy risk in terms of the expectations that will be built and the emotional burden on the viewers i am grateful for them wrapping up this story here and now with this level of quality",
        "glorious",
        "and jayce is having those weird split personality animations  \n  \ntheres definitely something more there than just he went to the future and saw something bad",
        "we know the healing is not really healing and jayce survived wherever or whenever he was sent to and the invisible character developement jayce being able to kill salo confident hextech is a curse and the flashes of masked when jayce is seeing people viktor touched points toward a danger we are not seeing the flashes in jayces head are mostly himself vowing not to fail to someone i suspect ekko andor heim viktor got a hivemind and whatever is presenting as sky in his head",
        "but i also dont get what singed is even doing outside his lab i guess he was just curious about greater world events \n\nsinged is literally just looking for ways to reverse death which he can then use on his daughter and incrementally getting closer to finding it\n\nhe first started with rio the suffering creature he introduced to viktor that he was experimenting on and artificially keeping alive from there he presumably used whatever he learned from rio to make shimmer and he probably just worked with silco as a person whod financesupport his research \n\n and why did he turn vander into a wolf tank the way he saved jinx seemed much more subtle \n\nnow note that singed would have been experimenting on vander for years before he saved jinx so he wouldve been able to learn from his experiments on vander and improved his techniques by the time he had to save jinx and so the changes to jinx are more subtle also vander had much more severe injuries than jinx did he was like overdosed on an early version of shimmer tanked a hextech explosion fell from however many stories multiple times and fought with a shimmer enhanced guy jinx fought against a regular human and tanked a grenade that is presumably much weaker than a hextech explosion so singed probably had to take more drastic steps to save vander like maybe the pistons with stuff in it on vanders back are stabilizing chemicals to keep vander alive and the wolf heart is the only thing strong enough to support the new body so the wolf tank appearance is just a side effect \n\n hmm maybe the wolf tank part was silcos idea he wanted to turn the fox back into a literal wolf\n\ni doubt it silco likely didnt even know about it happening he wouldnt have gone to the vander statue in s the way he did otherwise",
        "you reach true jayce fandom when you accept how much of a walking l taker this man is\n\nseriously jinx has some competition with how unlucky and terrible choice prone jayce is",
        "i feel like the long time gap since season  has made people forget this \n\nthe hexcore is completely evil it ate a human soul punished viktor when he tried to destroy it and viktor wanted jayce to destroy it \n\nnow suddenly sky is appearing to viktor and making him split from jayce by drawing his attention to the hextech weapons and then guides him to a community of broken people who need hextech to survive \n\nall while the hexcore is blighting ekkos home the people who actually helped the undercity without evil magic while pushing viktor to use and consume more and more hextech himself \n\nnah that thing is evil jayces mistake wasnt attacking viktor now it was lodging the damn thing in viktor after viktor made him promise hed destroy it",

        "this is one of the best episodes of television ive ever seen my favorite of the show by far ekkos segment was heartbreakingly sweet leaving behind the perfect world where he had everything he wanted because he is a good person i was so hooked in that romance ekko is a stronger man than me to leave it all behind and heimerdinger sacrificed himself to make it happen i really wonder how the show will progress now ekko having unlocked time travel and jayce seeing what the future can bring the whole future world was haunting and i guess those robots were what was left of mankind",
        "i love this episode so much having a peaceful timeline where everybodys alive and happy is my favorite thing ever powder and ekko actually got to express their feelings for each other here and i think now ekko is going to try and save jinx in the main timeline he knows now she cant be too far gone\n\nseeing the old crew back together along with silco vander and benzo made me tear up so much i cant tell you how much i love that silco in this timeline chose to forgive vander\n\ni hope heimerdinger didnt sacrifice himself and just got sent into another timeline but if he did godspeed you magnificent yordle\n\npoor jayce now witnessed the apocalypse caused by hextech maybe thats what it would do once viktor spread it to enough people its selfreplicating and selfanhilating after all",

        "can we just appreciate heimerdinger arc\n\nhe went from a revered scientist that was comfortable and content in his accomplishments beginning to disconnect from the sufferings and hardships of others from his tower more concerned with safeguarding and gating progress in the interest of safety knowing that he will live long enough to see the benefits even if others wont his legacy is secure\n\nafter everything hes been through hes finally learned to live in the moment he realises that there is no greater joy than helping those in the here and now even if its a small as giving a homeless child a toy or singing a song in the square for all to hear \n\ncontrast the theatre scene where heimer is gleefully humming along to the glamorous violinist whilst everyone is scheming in the face of a literal storm to the scene where he is now the one playing his banjo for the people of zaun\n\nand now at the end he actually rushes the development of ekkos time device and ultimately sacrifices himself to save the parallel world that cast him out even though he was right all along \n\nsince ive met you ladive truly lived",

        "having season  ep  end with jinx and ekko fighting then having powder and ekko dance and kiss in season  ep  was a really nice parallel",
        "just had a theory\n\nthis episode is a world where singeds daughter lived he never pursues shimmer for body modification he never trains viktor \n\nin almost every part of arcane he has some influence on every event but in this one theres no indication of drug addiction or crime in zaun singed is normally responsible for the rise of drug lords in the underground so zaun gets actually decent leaders instead\n\nwhatever killed his daughter never happened so he doesnt have a watershed moment and turn into walter white thats why zaun escapes poverty",

        "well this episode definitely justifies what jayce did in ep to me dude went through the pits of hell",
        "riot please give me nohextech powder skin i swear i will pay your  price",
        "i heard that french song and was like stromae and indeeed",
        "the record player at the very start of the episode for the netflix series bit right at the beginning had powder and ekkos faces instead of jinx and vi",
        "ekko literally living the dream scenario i am green with envy screw the real world someone create an arcane nervegear and sign me up",
        "i guess this is the series i always wanted i yearned for seeing powder to be quite normal is nice this seems like the time line where zaun has at least a chance and all it took was jayce to get blown to bits lol\n\nbut then again arcane without the arcane would just be",
        "i could definitely imagine a spinoff where powder from this alternate reality tries to come back for vi in another timeline or the past especially now that shes certain ekko isnt from their world plus knowing she had those hextech marbles hidden in a drawer and now has all the notes she needs",
        "powder is so pretty \n\ncrying again",
        "i really like the dance scene of ekko and powderjinx\nit can be seen that ekko appreciated every second they spent with each other and if he could he would go back in time just to live for the moment with her\n\nalso funny thing is while ekko was living his best life\njayce was living in a nightmare",
        "the song that plays during ekko and powders dance is so perfect for them the lyrics explain exactly how ekko feels and its so beautifully crafted i just melted seeing them together",
        "so ekko and heimer were literally sent to the universe where they invented therapy",
        "whole episode got me extremely fucked up cried all the way through bruh so they just off my boy heimerdinger just like that my second favorite character too whos next ekko so so painful\n\n\nedit you know i havent seen anyone talk about the fact that only in this episode vi actually isnt on the disc in the first netflix intro wow",
        "this was among the best episodes in the series ekko didnt get a ton of time this season but he delivers every single minute hes on screen alternate reality powder is adorable and heartbreaking on so many levels man",
        "according to lore yordles are actually immortal that is why they have long lifespan so the heimer that died on this scene is the memory that he and ekko shared throughout their journey",
        "also is it just me or is claggor kind of hot in this universe",
        "this is it everyone thanks for the fun ride",
        "my man jayce playing getting over it",
        "favorite episode of the season",
        "they are so beautiful god these two this episode is everything to me inventing interdimensional travel with my gf in her cave air ballon lab fuck yes  \nthe kiss them being cautious like that gosh theyre so sweet and tender and gorgeous fuckkkkkkkk the dance i am breathless going insane feral  \nthis is how i want my life to be im pivoting life to whatever can bring me closer to being ekko dropping everything dont care want",
        "ekko making benzo cry i cant",
        "getting to see an alternative timeline where the heist went wrong right and all the kids besides vi got to grow up wasnt on my bingo list with ekko being the time traveller i should have expected a flashpoint style plotline yet still this show always manages to blindside me",
        "takes a great man like ekko to abandon this perfect world and come back to the misery he came from pretty much the opposite of cypher from matrix the guy from the steak scene who betrays his buddies in exchange for living in a false utopia",
        "might be the best episode of the act this episode is always going to be the happy one\n\nedited because im new here and dont want to include spoilers",
        "damn this episode had me tearing up three times\n\n ekkos talk with benzo at the party\n ekkojinx kiss scene\n ekkos farewell scene\n\nalso are those husk zombie things supposed to be people viktor healed in that reality",
        "no matter how this season ends\n\nits good to know that there is an alt piltover thats peaceful where the undercity and top side are co existing\n\nwhere vander and silco let bygones be bygones\n\nwhere jinx is powder and using her brilliance to built things to help\n\nwhat a great episode to give us a glimpse of what could had been\n\nbeautiful",
        "theres a shocking lack of discussion of the flashback to vis death coupled with heimers song that  destroyed me just the way powders reaction was so similar to the why did you leave me scene and the speechless looks of disbelief on mylo and claggors faces",
        "okay possibly my fav episode in the new season i cried about four times seeing a world where vi was sacrificed so everyone else survived was so emotional especially the scene of vi dying and powder crying her name the way she did in season one when everything went wrong actually crazy idk how they do it also a moment for powders space buns i love artsy powder and the mural of vi was so beautiful and silco and vander together and milo and claggor oh my there is just so much that made me feel many things and i have to say the alternate piltover was so lovely the artists and designers on this show do a fantastic job every time",
        "i was not expecting ekko and powder to be the best relationship of the show crazy",
        "in the parallel dimension where ekko and heimer were transported its probably not just vi being dead but also jayce and viktor since viktor decided not to help jayce because he indirectly caused a death of a zaunite child jayce probably killed himself and then viktor died because of his disease some time later without hextech",
        "when ekko asked powder if she was the one who caused vis death in this reality she pointed out that ekko gave them the tip  that led to the job when they were younger to me it wasnt to blame him for anything but simply a reminder for the viewers that he always had a part with the tragic beginning and why hes also part of the fix it was a good detail to add",
        "the alt universe ekko got sent to is now in my head canon as the actual one sorry",
        "yeah he was cooked",
        "i wasnt ready for that heimer scene that was really fucking rough",
        "ekko is a better man than me i would have folded on my old universe for jinx",
        "it was kinda heartbreaking because in the only universe silcos and vanders dream independent zaun came true is where vis dead",
        "this episode is just chefs kiss\n\n\na timeline where jinxpowder is happy is all i ever wanted from arcane \n\n\nthe songsmusic were spot on too",
        "deleted",
        "i would love to dream about this episode once again that dance scene of ekko and jinx was straight on beautiful and dramatic",
        "best episode in the whole series",
        "as someone who never played the games or knew at all that timebomb was a thing i was so surprised by this episode in the best way after the show ive rewatched it over and over and it cuts deep every time\n\nsuch a beautiful world but theres a bittersweet feeling to it because vi is dead i dont think its because the writers hate vi i think its to show that even the most beautiful timeline isnt perfect you always sacrifice something for perfection which fits with the theme of the show\n\ni know some might call it a filler episode but i dont think so at all the aus are so important for us to understand the main universe to show us how things could be so much better and also that things could be so much worse makes the stakes that much higher\u00a0\n\nand as someone who likes emotional arcs and characterrelationship developments and all their complexities and nuances over action fight sequences  something s was so good at but had been lacking a bit in s before this episode  this one was just perfect in giving it all to me in a wellcontained  something minutes good storytelling is show dont tell and they really did that just the looks between powder and ekko say so much\n\nand the music in this episode too the french song and heimerdingers song are on my top favorites from the soundtrack",
        "the timebombers will now never shut up will they",
        "feck is jayce going to tear eh from their nice timeline back to the fucked up one\n\npoor powder she deserves to exist and have a full life",
        "even in a parallel universe riot couldnt give us a perfect happy world rip parallel vi",
        "two writers wrote au arcane fanfics\n\none writer got to live out their dream of a beautiful prosperous zaun with romance redemption and just a hint of tragedy\n\nthe other snorted a bunch of cocaine and sent jayce to the fucking postapocalyptic metal wasteland",
        "i really like the fact that ever since jayce has made his big hammer he carries it wherever he goes\n\nas if the mercury hammer was a part of him xd \n\ni like their relationship haha",
        "this episode was hands down the best in arcane as a whole for me the personal stories the foreshadowing and set ups and the realism behind each interaction just an absolute marvel",
        "favourite episode in the entire series was just so good im bawling my eyes out hahahahaha dont think ive ever cried at a show like this",
        "why did jayce get separated from ekko and heimerdinger because he died in that universethere was nowhere for his consciousness to occupy so the anomaly sent him to the only place everyone still existsthe future its a terrifying thought that all the beings we see in that timelineincluding jayce atop the hexgate towerare still alive in the future of the glorious evolution viktor createdthis also leads me to believe caitlyn died in the heist blast as well as vibecause soulmates",
        "lmao that cut from ekkopowder enjoying their dance to jayce in hellscape poor bastard haha",
        "really wish the show was made into three seasons we really could have used    episodes of this au ekko and powder story would have made it all the more emotional when ekko finally returns to his original universe",
        "i want to stay in this what if dimension",
        "ekko gets a gf and jayce gets sent to caelid luck of the draw lmao",
        "i wonder if marcus also became better in this au and was one of reasons the enforcers became less assholes he looked really sympathetic seeing au vi dead and powder crying might have reminded him of his daughter and seeing as no blackmail he became a better man",
        "i find it kind of funny that in a way vi dying literally destroyed fascism",
        "well that was a whiplash it felt really good seeing everyone happy minus vi being dead zaun and piltover is united as one nation no civil war silco and vander is alive powder and ekko is together it really put in the perspective of how fucked the arcane timeline is lol\n\nthis episode really pointed out how much i just wanted the characters to be happy i wonder what happens with heimer he wasnt in the device so didnt get transferred and as we saw with ekko once you are gone you poof away and the guy you replaced initially pops back",
        "this episode has ruined my life",
        "this episode made me all misty with the powder benzo and heimendinger scenes i like the contrast between jayce and ekkos journeys while jayce saw the downfall of piltover ekko saw the paradise he fought for in zaun its definitely my favorite episode this season so far",
        "how many people here completely overlooked the alternate record art at the very beginning of the episode im watching youtube reactions now and cannot believe i missed that",
        "me when ekko pulls away from the initial kiss dog whatre you doing kiss her on the mouth oh yeah ok thats cool too lol",
        "they better bring himerdinger backkkk",
        "thats it the au is now the canon universe for me i dont wanna get back to the sad one",
        "so wait is this alt reality saying that vi being alive is what held piltover and zaun from making peace and going forward\n\nfuck riot you gotta keep kicking vi even when she doesnt exist anymore",
        "so does this mean that powder knew what was going on because it has happened multiple times before or am i misreading that bag of hextech and the flipping coin thingy she put next to it in that drawer",
        "is a peaceful prosperus zaun where powder is happy and sane really worth vis death",
        "theres actually a universe where jinx has lasting happiness never thought id see the day not vi though shes either miserable or dead those are her only options i almost thought ekko would have to destroy the whole world to go back to the one he came from just to make sure jinx cant be happy",
        "i love how powder has a tiny strand of red hair on one of her hair buns",
        "im at a loss for words",
        "i gotta say i was so pissed off for the first  minutes of this one im just someone who has felt so multiversedout lately its the direction that nearly every popular scifi medium has taken at this point and im just tired of it man\u00a0\n\nso when this episode managed to slowly turn that hatred into complete and utter love it really stood out in just over  minutes i saw a legitimately amazing execution of the multiverse cliche it takes truly amazing writers to do that i went in so upset that we have  episodes left and the writers wasted one on a multiverse filler then as it goes on you realize its that same top tier arcane writing giving you the middle finger for having the balls to think this is just filler content the dance scene between echo and powder was unbelievably beautiful and for this shownto take one of my most hated tropes and turn it into something incredible is a feat and a half im blown away man glad were entering next episode in the original timeline but im truly shocked at how they managed to make this weird oneoff multiverse arc into something that i unabashedly loved fucking cheers bro i love this show so goddamn much",
        "honestly the end of the episode for me at least foreshadowed powder experimenting with hextech after ekko left maybe she wants to go visit and see vi and ekko again or maybe she wants to use it for other purposes i dont really see the scene as a trophy drawermemory chestetc i think until then she had no reason to experiment with hextech and now that ekko has left behind his notes she could very well rebuild the z drive she fell in love with the wrong version of ekko after all i also wonder what happened to heimerdinger since yordles are hard af to kill permanently",
        "heimendinger",
        "anyways did you guys realized that jinxs necklace on this episode is the one that vi has on the very first of this show",
        "this whole episode was surreal holy fuck\n\n please tell me the hooded figure is viktor\n finally seeing ekkos origin scratched my brain so well\n jinx x ekko they really asked the writers to go fullon fanfic mode\n\nand as usual every character has banger lines",
        "why am i crying omg",
        "god that jayce skin is looking even more enticing now",
        "this episode was fucking lovely i loved everything about it \n\nthat is all",
        "best episode of the act by far",
        "also loved the animation of ekko in the time loop ball thingy and how each time a bit of it passed in front of him it showed his original universe self with the hair and all",
        "didnt realize thats why the opening coin looks weird its au ekko and jinx",
        "vi got the opposite of its a wonderful life",
        "an alternate universe huh it was cool seeing silco vander mylo claggor and normal powder\n\nnow i understand why jayce did what he did last episode",
        "jayce got sent to the freaking third impact",
        "did anyone else catch the second look claggor gives mylo at the prom when hes putting his arms around him mylo was clearly shown interested in the server girl earlier in the episode i wonder if this little look was supposed to be unrequited love from claggors side",
        "i just dont understand what ekko meant when he said can we just pretend like its the first time",
        "this might be one of my of my favourite episodes i like alternate timeline storylines and this was short and sweet also the stark difference between ekkos experience and jayces was comical found myself laughing every time an ekko scene cut to jayce in literal hell",
        "ya know i thought the ending would be dark and tragic i was relieved it wasnt i didnt seeneed to see more powderjynx suffering although vi is dead in this universe her life is stable and shes clearly with ekko thank you arcane for both breaking me with a universe of what couldve been and not breaking my heart at the end",
        "what a beautiful episode i love this show so so much",
        "im not an emotional person these days for some reason this episode hit me right in my feels i feel like ekkos story resonates with me core not telling the ones you love and admire how much you appreciate them the regret of not doing so after they are gone so eloquently paired with the music as well its like he lived that second chance for all of us but then still suffering the loss over again episode  was a beautiful masterpiece brought up some shit for me but i guess it was needed damn an animated series too the world is wild sometimes",
        "heimerdinger really was like well i made quite a mess in my own timeline\n\n here the only thing i shall invent is folk music\n\n  \nim still reeling the day after the music the tragedy the feels what an incredible episode favorite gut punches\n\n again heimerdinger becoming a folk singer\n\n the buildup to finding out why the episode is called pretend like its the first time like it makes sense throughout but then when ekko says the line it drives the emotional nail straight into your heart also because\n\n he probably had just enough time with this jinx to start falling in love with her and he gives her that kiss knowing its his first but also his last with herrrraisjldjailsdrj crying\n\n love the walk through the lanes at the beginning of heimerdingers song love him walking in front of what is essentially a bagel shop like the lanes got gentrified\n\n all growd up claggor looking fine as hell and then also hes gay \n\n\n\nyeah anyway im still crying this episode should win an award",
        "best ep of act",
        "very bold choice to make the third from last episode entirely set in alternate timelines absolutely fantastic though",
        "best episode of s imho",
        "this is my absolute favourite episode of the whole show pretty hard considering the quality of the other ones to my mind se has finally been toppled\n\nits tightly written almost could be seen as a self contained story at least for ekkos part it features everything i like to see a quest companions love and a final sacrifice on top it gave me something i was starving for seeing powderjinx get a measure of happiness also loved that ekko got to be center stage on this one even benzo got some love\n\namazing bravo to fortiche and riot\n\nps the dance song slaps",
        "alt reality powder super cute",
        "i feel like this show can be summed up in one phrase what couldve been\n\nexhibit a vander claggor and mylo alive and a world where powder isnt sent off spiraling into what would become jinx",
        "oh i missed benzo so much so happy ekko got that closure",
        "ah i really wanted to see vi in the alternate dimension",
        "i couldnt help but laugh that ekko and heimerdinger wound up in a fairly idyllic little timeline while jayce fucking wound up in the game scorn",
        "do we know why for the ending adult powder puts away the necklace ekko got for her into vis cabinet i feel like theres a meaning behind this but i dont get it",
        "the scene with ekko  jinx dancing and talking later as the french song plays i cannot get it out of my head since  days its just magical but also sad because it was not to be but still amazing like a moment captured eternally the track was sooo good too",
        "the scene of ekko and powder dancing to french music is the most beautifully animated sequence ive ever seen",
        "this might be one of the best episodes of tv ive ever watched",
        "double kill on jayce and vi is crazy\n\nyet another jayce l he dies and everything gets better lol",
        "the lyrics of spin the wheel the song that heimerginger plays in the beginning of the episode are interestingit is completely opposed to what both the characters are trying to do in the visuals  the song is very carefree and sings about sitting back and letting the gears turn while both the characters have a very determined outlook  a goal they are moving toward",
        "rewatching heimerdingers last scene just before he joined the wiring together he gives ekko one last look like he knew it be his goodbye\u00a0\n\nnow its like theres rain on my face but ive been indoors all day",
        "i cried watching ekko and au powder dance",
        "ekko stronger than me i woulda made sure to hit it first before leaving",
        "omg jayce is in the bad place",
        "welp my heart wasnt ready for that",
        "the dance scene of ekko and powder was so damn beautiful truly one of the best moments of arcane i absolutely loved the animation",
        "ngl i would have preferred to see an au where silco and vander never became enemies\n\ntheir relationship influenced the events of the first season so seeing an alternate version of it could have been interesting",
        "fuck me they killed heim anyone could be up then",
        "my favorite episode so far",
        "i fully expected a dark reveal that jayce is in the same world as ekkoheimerdinger but way in the future and that the creation of the anomaly pretty much destroyed the world",
        "yeah this is my favourite episode of the season no question timebomb nation we won",
        "i cried that was beautiful",
        "never doubted my man jayce",
        "thinking about it some more i think episode  was almost perfect but even that felt rushed we couldve gottem a whole act from the ekko story he gives up on the perfect timeline too easy and that ruins the episode for me that was the city he wanted and it felt like he didnt even got too think about it\n\ni get it the reason he has people needing him vi is dead and everything but it need more of a struggle from him to make the loss of the perfect timeline more impactful it was so fast it felt like a dream a good one tho",
        "this might just be my favorite episode of any show ever",
        "ekko was like right its business time while heimerdinger is reliving his bob dylan phase",
        "i cant believe they killed off heimerdinger",
        "ekko   having the best time of his life\n\njayce  crawling in my skinnnn",
        "i dont see anyone talking about the crystals powder had right at the end in her drawer did she not know they probably wouldve been helpful or did she just want to spend time with ekko also the necklace",
        "dude the scene on the bridge the juxtaposition of this beautiful world and then the reality of his world this beautiful powder who is like the one he knew growing up and the neardead ravaged by mental illness and violence jinx who hes had to nearly kill to save others makes you think about people in war torn places and the juxtaposition of the life they had before to standing in a destroyed home that part of the episode tears me apart more than anything",
        "is there a larger significance of the multicolor gear they keep showing in the original universe victor has it and then jinx plays with it too in the au ekko finds it on powders work table",
        "anyone notice that that gesture powder does to ekkos forehead to cover for his weird behaviour to benzo is the same as young powder does in their bridge fight",
        "powder has a roman numeral  on her face in the form of a tear stain this number is the exact number of seconds ecco can rewind time wow",
        "the name was cool and all butwhy wasnt it called what could have been",
        "a musical banjo number by heimerdinger was not on my bingo card but i am not complaining",
        "honestly i loved it this kind of twisty storytelling felt closer to s than any episode in s so far for me",
        "make a whole other show about the alternate timeline",
        "i have no netflix",
        "holy shit tbskyen was right that well dressed ekko was from an alternate reality",
        "jayces ptsd becoming clearer",
        "ekko just rizzed up powder eh truly the rizzmaster",
        "heimerdinger better not be gone man",
        "see jayce was right",
        "jinx with her hair down\n\ngifgiphygfroogpshfeaknqw",
        "jayce out here in a dark souls map",
        "this episodes has big spider verse vibes especially with the wild rune multiverse portal powder and ekko remind me of gwen and miles",
        "this was an absolute highlight of the show for me how very wonderful",
        "i love how ep in s captured the fight between ekko and jinx and here on ep s we have them dancing on ma meilleure ennemie  love it",
        "i genuinely cried at this one idk those what could have been scenes in shows always make me feel something i cant explain",
        "what i believe the ekkoverse and the arcaneverse diverged at the point when hex raw crystal smashed to the wall between the room and the corridor instead of that between the room and balcony which causes vis death which explains no balcony collapse of jayces dorm the explosion would also possibly kills jayce and caitlyn possibly answering why jayce traveled to future instead of traveling to ekkoverse together with ekko and heimerdinger also  heimer mentioned about no hextech in ekkoverse which possibly affirms no jayce no hextech obsession no partner for viktor to get inspired afterall etc so what i want to say is that it was not only vi who died in the hexplosion but there were also jayce and caitlyn whose lifes were possibly taken in the collateral damage any ideas",
        "damn great episode i wonder who is more bad ass the guy who chose to leave the perfect universe or the guy who escaped the worst possible universe",
        "ekko and jinx having their unspoken connection have its moment was something we needed in act iii to recover from act ii the graphics throughout have been unreal",
        "ekko a better man than me i woulda just stayed enjoying my life there i cant lie",
        "heimerdinger singing was goat",
        "the ending makes me wonder if this version of powder will return either in the next two episodes or in some other show they have planned\n\nedit also how did vi die in that universe i got confused",
        "getting over it with jayce talis",
        "loved this episode but i really dont buy that no hex tech is enough to result in this outcome silco was already developing shimmer and was planning to use it to take control of zaun and fight for independence from piltover he really never seems to care about vi at all in fact he literally lures vi and all vaders kids to his lair so he can kill them jinx implies that vanders apology would have made a difference so i suppose that is implied to have actually happened in this timeline but tbh i just dont believe silco could forgive vander that easily",
        "heres my theory for how the almost ideal world came to be on the other side of the anomaly  \n  \n silco found the letter which resulting in him coming back and having a more active and present role in the lives of the kid group  \n this made it so vi grew up with a slight change in her role models and acted a bit differently when they went on that job to rob jayce  \n in our timeline she already barely made it outside before the explosion a slight change in her actions delaying her for even a second was enough for her to die there  \n jayce finding a dead child in his exploded workshop as a result of his hextech reacted similarly to when he accidentally killed that factory kid in our timeline he called the whole thing off and tried to walk away from it  \n with jayce admitting to his research but not showing the will to continue it he was likely given a similar treatment by the council as he received in our timeline a firm reprimand and being kicked out of the academy forbidden from further research  \n jayce explaining the dangers of hextech instead of how it could help people meant viktor was not inspired by it and did not return to the workshop to talk to him about it  \n with his lifes work resulting in death and destruction and getting no backing or encouragement from others jayce carries through with his attempt like in our timeline but with no interruptions  \n because powder did not leave after the explosion we see her holding vis body in the room still holding the other crystals she likely got caught by the enforcers  \n heimerdinger having a personal stake in the incident due to jayce being an academy scholar he likely met and spoke with powder during questioning discovering her talent as an inventor  \n between vander hound of the underground and silco the industrialist putting pressure on their enforcer contact chief grayson and heimerdinger having a soft spot for inventors powder was likely released with only a light punishment for being involved with a robbery after jayce took the blame for his creation  \n now actively aware that there are inventors in the undercity that arent associated with his academy heimerdinger and his assistant who he now remembers is also from the undercity go there in person and meet powder ecko benzo and other inventors from below while also seeing their living conditions in person for the first time in many years  \n silco knows an opportunity when he sees one and with vanders help convinces councilor heimerdinger to work with them to improve the undercity and make strides toward making zuan possible framing it as a way for the undercity to come together and provide friendly competition to the inventors of piltover that they just need a little help getting to the starting line  \n a few years pass and we get the world we see in the anomaly  \n  \nalso i have seen a lot of people who seem think heimerdinger arrived in this dimension  years ago and could have changed a bunch of stuff personally no rewatch it he said  days ago hes been there for like  years thats well after the job happened",
        "rip my boi heimer gotta give that man a  donger salute",
        "man that was a great episode really hit me in the feels even a couple days later\n\njynx is such a chaotic character its nice to see that its not her true nature to be that way its merely an expression of her nature brought on by trauma being raised by silco losing vander being rejected by vi and just the state of the world \n\nwhat a gift to ekko to get to experience it aside from vi being dead it was basically their idealized version of the world made real they were so close to it in their own timeline\n\nive probably watched the scene with ekko and powder at the dance and their conversation half a dozen times now beautifully done and that song is really perfect for the scene\n\nive never played lol and i dont know anything about the lore outside of whats given in the show but theyve done a really great job at world building and crafting these characters its a shame that we only get two seasons of this hopefully they decide to do more with it",
        "my favorite episode please someone tell me the name of the sound that plays when jayce is trapped in the bad universe",
        "gotta love how the others get a taste of the good life meanwhile jayce gets chucked into the literal pits of hell",
        "damn this episode broke me",
        "fuck man thats such a good version of their world",
        "so uh  best episode of the series maybe i cried twice\n\nready for these next couple episodes though missing caitvi",
        "rewatching and giggling at these writers saying look at how peaceful this timeline is without those gays  j",
        "ive seen heimerdinger blowing up and i am shitting myself",
        "genuinely the first episode i felt was perfectly paced this was a really good delve into the alt reality i really liked seeing everyone happy",
        "is heimer legit dead",
        "heimerdingers song slaps",
        "the one timeline alt universe where powders allowed to be happy",
        "the most beautiful episode so far",
        "heimerdinger you da real mvp",
        "so what happened to vi and powders mom in the ekko timeline",
        "at the end of the episode the credits showed for juliet with love what did it mean whos juliet anyone got some context i wanna know",
        "no way seeing powder and ekko made a grown ahh me tear up what is this show",
        "whats the song at the credits",
        "the vi doll i just cant \n\nsobbing from this episode",
        "powder and ekko having their dance at almost the same time they had the bridge fight in x",
        "i have to say that as soon as i saw powder lighting up the candles and then the scene shifted to the vi plushie doll  i had to pause and just cry i cried my heart out like a baby \n\neverything is right in this universe mylo claggor and vander are alive powder is the cutest little lady ever and ekko being the handsome guy that he is they all look happy and they are smiling but everything is also wrong with it because vi is dead in this universe \n\nthe writer was teasing us when they showed us gert s figure making us think that she was vi but no then powder was like hey im gonna go and see vi i screamed yes because in my mind i imagine the life that vi deserves to live happily with her family i imagine a vi that doesnt suffer anymore \n\nbut my heart breaks i literally had to pause and cry is this necessary but i know deep inside if vi would kill for her family she would also die for them and that truly breaks my heart because i just want her to be happy with the fambam and as reconciliation the writer gave us her memorial picture by ekko that will not redeem anything\ni understand its for the sake of the plot but im grieving \n\nim just glad that in the main universe vi and jinx finally healed their relationship",
        "wait so in what moment did hextech destroy piltover in that alternate universe was it during the breakthrough of hextech in season  act  but it went bad",
        "i sobbed through the entire thing",
        "i already watched this episode x today eyes swollen heart aching masterpiece",
        "what a beautiful episode to know that if some things had changed just a tiny bit they all could have had a happy ending except for vi",
        "oh man this might just be the greatest episode in the entire series",
        "heimerdinger isnt dead he respawned back in bandleader city yordles dont die",
        "im confused is heimer dead because wikipedia says he shifted to another dimension again",
        "question did echo gift jinx that rose necklace not sure why jinx put it away at the end",
        "man i really wanted powder to meet jinx and vi that shit wouldve gone crazy",
        "this episode was beautiful yet the definition of bittersweet to me it was lovely seeing ekko and poweder finally reunite the contrast between the two aus was really interesting with ekko and heimerdinger in a timeline without conflict and suffering and jayce in one where all was lost and this episode finally slowed down to let us breathe and take it all in the emotion was really there with not only adult powder and the relationship with ekko but also the simple fact that everything felt good there like a blissful dream of what could have been from piltover and zaun prospering together to the people living free innovative lives seeing our boys mylo and claggor all grown up and vander and silko not only alive but friends again was fan service at best only topped by ekko and powder dancing and kissing as if they were meant to all along seeing the flashbacks of how the good au timeline split during the job explosion with young powder holding vis dead body in her arms was raw and very emotional jayce growing depressed and crazy stuck in the cave not knowing if his au was the real future or if he would even live to see the outside again and the ending either heimerdingers sacrifice and yet ekko giving it all up all he could ever have hoped to achieve in his life in this au to not give up on his own universe and his jinx bittersweet\n\nthat was my very long summarized take on why i love this episode so much and its one of my all time favorites",
        "this was beautiful powder and ekko together was justurghthese poor damn kids also heimderdingers song the first genuinely emotionally impactful musical moment to me this season in general i feel like the third act was a lot better than the two before it",
        "the montage with ekko powder and heimerdinger working in the workshop seeing the glances powder was giving ekko had me crying just thinking about how much she obviously likes him then the dance scene and the music hit and i was just ugly sobbing i frigging love this show",
        "its heart breaking for ekko man leaving the perfect universe back to his original universe only to lose powderjinx again\n\nthe  frames per second dance scene the french song lyrics their happy faces truly what could have been",
        "everything being better if vi dies on that job is crazy silco even forgives vander",
        "taken on its own this has to be the best episode of the season so far however im worried that taking a whole episode out where most of it doesnt advance the plot much is gonna hurt the rest of this arc\n\nat least we know that universes ekko and powder get to live a happy life together as long as these events dont tempt her to use those stones",
        "i love all the theories that he was being controlled by something \n\nmeanwhile it turns out he just had a really fucking bad time",
        "ekko the real mvp for having the strength to leave that universe",
        "the cut from the kiss to jayce was freaking hilarious",
        "so many were hating on him for blasting viktor aka the hexcore while in reality he clearly didnt want to but saw what it can mean literally the end of the world",
        "srsly the comparing scenes cutting in and out got me laughing so badly",
        "the way he just stumbled into that first hug man they did a whole lot with very little time there",
        "damn allergies",
        "he even used the past tense and no one noticed probably for the best the scene is already so sad",
        "i replayed benzos reaction to that fivesix times",
        "this episode is legit full of so many beautiful life lessons",
        "this episode had me in shambles in front of my friends my father died  years ago and ive thought of a lot of things i would have done differently had i known my time was so truly limited with him we had a good relationship as is but its always good to remind people how much they mean to you",
        "who was that guy",
        "often i dislike these kind of cameoeaster eggs but in this episode it seems to make a lot of sense with how well crafted vander and silco are as characters         \n\nvi dying at the heist means no hex tech and over time lessening inequalities between piltover and zaun the kids are caught at jayces flat so no need for vander to cover for them or increase tension with silco and the enforcers  it makes it far easier for vander to maintain peace in the undercity          \n\nid love to analyse it more but i think its not so much the absence of vi but that her dying was a good reason to cancel hex tech and prevent rising tension it may have worked with any of the others dying too",
        "vi needs a break",
        "if i were to guess on the sequence of events jayce gets fucked because a kid died in the explosion so no hextech while vi dying caused a social movement in piltover which escalted into better rights and conditions for the undercity because for once one of those undercity kids just happened to die in the middle of the city rather than out of sight out of mind which lead to silco deescalating his plans and eventually making up with vander probably after going to the old hideout from earlier this season\n\ni do wonder what the long term of that timeline could be especially considering hextech may have just been reintroduced to the timeline by ekko to be fair i expect it will probably end up being needed in the long term with how many coming crisis events there are in runeterra so this might have otherwise been a good short term bad long term timeline",
        "oh boy vi be like eat the rich\n\nwhich she gladly did",
        "powder and ekko got a prom",
        "i posted long ago about this and im so glad it came to fruition  powpow was always my spirit character",
        "i feel the same way as someone who has always related to and had a lot of feelings about powder as a character i never wanted a happy ending for jinx where her life looks like this because i thought it wouldnt be realistic in a way that honors everything she went through and who it made her but this was the perfect way to give it to us she doesnt always have to suffer in some version of life she gets to just be",
        "see this scene got me in the feels i was just like aww powder is happy",
        "that scene was so beautifully animated when ekko said something like can we pretend this is the first time and powder looked into his eyes smiling my heart melted and the music is just perfect",
        "my favourite episode up to this point and one of the best alternate life episodes of tv ive ever watched",
        "love the  sec reference to his ingame ultimate",
        "that image is gonna be burned into ekkos eyelids for the rest of his life",
        "that traumatized look on his face after seeing what happened to heimer",
        "his crashout of the century is  justified after that trip through hell",
        "so donger is dead",
        "to be fair heimerdinger also got exploded in ekkos heaven  twice",
        "jayce seeing the hat man everywhere he looks",
        "its nice to see a happy version also they implied she was still a little nuts which i liked",
        "if all eelse comes crashing down we know there is a universe out there where shes happy plus ekko is still with her there i was dreading that the jump back would kill the original au ekko",
        "i was bawling the entire episode ekko seeing all the family he lost be alive happy and living in peace knowing he can never stay with them  hes such and incredibly strong character i feel like most people would succumb due to love of their lost ones and not push forward out of loyalty to the ones still alive in the original universe",
        "i cried during that scene too it immediately made me think of the soundtrack what couldve been in s finale",
        "it was so cruel seeing what couldve been an alternative life so many regrets",
        "i also cried at that moment just to know how it could have been was beautiful to both powder and ekko",
        "",
        "how does it feel to be on the other side of the cutting between one dude having the best time of his life and another having the worstscene jayce",
        "jayce everyone is dead life is suffering\n\nekko cutie goth girlfriend here i come \n\nfor real though the only thing wrong with ekkos world was dat mustache",
        "im pretty sure he wasnt in that universe because he also died along with vi in the explosion",
        "i started crying the instant i saw adult powder and basically didnt stop the entire episode",
        "with the power of the zdrive we can have infinite dead heimerdingers",
        "why twice",
        "she is really the cutest  look how happy she is",
        "with her little strip of vis hair in her space bun",
        "ikr i was like omg did he just kill his body there to travel  then theres a dead ekko and a grieving jinx with arcane stones and too much knowledge but then they made the au ekko wake up and i was like thank god",
        "at least the writers had the courtesy to give us this mercy",
        "i was jumpscare by jayce  like wtf i was enjoying ekko and powder and then bam jayce suddenly appeared",
        "arcane at its finest",
        "also he recognizes that it wasnt really powder that was responsible for the things that jinx did for all the multiple personality stuff that jinx suffers from this version of her is actually canonically a different person \n\nits basically powder if she never got corrupted by silco and still had vander and everyone else from her childhood to keep her grounded you cant really hold her accountable for stuff that she would have done if all of her friends and family died or disappeared and she was raised by someone who was much less concerned about killing and hurting people",
        "very possibly i think imo there was a finality at the end of the episode where she shut the door on the hex crystals i think by design that au might just be one without hex tech but idk with powders natural curiosity she may very well open it again pandoras box so to speak",
        "yes i need more people discussing this",
        "i think the biggest difference here is that powder chose not to use the hextech and thats why everyone is happy\n\nshe had the stones all along but wanted to work with ekko on his project because that made her happy as stated by vander\n\nin the end my view is that she still doesnt want to change that and will remain hiding the gemstones as she said she is happy with the things the way they are",
        "huh i never saw it as that more like the equivalent of a retired cop keeping their badge in their desk because vi died during the heist powder put that life behind her and intentionally didnt experiment with them she knew the cost was too high",
        "moreover it showed the reason why hextech happened  never came to be powder is the catalyst different being here that alt jinx took all the wild runes thus jayce was never able to create hextech\n\nalt jinx seeing our war torn ekko while her ekko was in her arms helped her realize that her world is better off without hextech thus helping her move on  leave the past behind \n\nbrilliant writing",
        "the part that got me the most is realizing vi herself would pick that world",
        "what i dont get yet though  why does he kill viktorhexcore and not the huge central hextech thing in which they were send throughout universes \n\nhavent seen the other two episodes yet though",
        "i mean convergence ekko singlepayer game by the end we have glimps of other universes",
        "you ever wish you could just stay in one moment",
        "sometimes taking a leap forward means leaving a few things behind",
        "just finished it and made me feel so melancholy i dont wanna go on",
        "mylo on the other hand maybe jinx did him a favor jk",
        "i turned to my friend while watching and said adult clagger is kinda and she looked at me like i was insane",
        "i was blown away by the entire episode first thing i did when i woke up this morning surprisingly when i saw claggor with his arms around milo there was no surprise at all  just oh that tracks",
        "ambessa dont know shit about sacrifice ekko gave up the dream",
        "for sure",
        "this reality is awesome minus vi being dead",
        "i swear arcane has to be the most effective minuteperquality cinematic piece ever i get why people complain about pacing but arcane is the epitome of the    rule could it have been longer to reach  sure but i am glad they stuck with the vision and told this nugget of lore in the condensed manner that they did",
        "it reminded me a bit of in another life i would have really liked doing just laundry and taxes with you from everything everywhere all at once\n\nthis studio could make a killer romance i bet i have a soft spot for animated romance your name your lie in april  centimeters per second",
        "honestly yeah man couldve honestly lived that life with his father figure and a powder that clearly loves him",
        "although it does make me feel a bit weird that clearly that universes ekko was still in there just suppressed i wonder how long that could have lasted realistically before causing some sort of problem",
        "absolutely adorable right i never even considered what shed been like if things were different kinda makes me wish i could see her grow up in this universe after all the dark and traumatic episodes this was a nice breather",
        "worst thing is his invention created hell while his and vis death created the utopia wouldve driven him extra mad",
        "jayce seeing the paradise world would probably be horrible for him too knowing that almost everything would be better if you werent in it probably sucks maybe not as much as ending up crippled in the hell dimension but close",
        "i want to know how that happened omg",
        "im not doing okay at all like he has a tan because that bitch sees sunlight and are him and vander a couple cause they were very touchy and after seeing the jackets hanging inside each other im like sirs",
        "i was smiling the whole time  can we pretend its the first time  i was blushing",
        "ikr her demeanor too great voice acting there to sound like a grown powder whos content with life just melted my heart every time i saw her",
        "id have just died at the bottom of that pit",
        "what makes you think he is",
        "we truly live in a time of lifetime",
        "with my busted ass leg",
        "even vander and silco made up  im now certain he wouldve truly regretted killing vi",
        "no its because vi is their leader vi is the symbol of hope for powder ekko claggor and mylo if vi dies powder would never turn to the other side vander and silco didnt fight each other and no civil war happened in the undercity",
        "i wonder if cait and jayce also died in the explosion which might be why we dont see them heimerdinger says that hextech was never invented there but surely jayce would have still continued his work on it and why would they not seek him out when they were trying to recreate the anomaly\n\nwe know that cait and jayce were outside the door when the explosion happened so its very possible that they could have also perished alongside vi",
        "i think its not about vi necessarily but maybe partly\n\nvi dies  jayce gets expelled or banished for sure  no hextech\n\nmaybe also vi dies  powder has to rely on herself and other people more  new found strength and community",
        "if nothing else i think it would make au jinx even more mentally unstable",
        "i dont think it was just vi i think the reason jayce didnt get teleported to this timeline was there was no version for him here to inhabit we saw in season  he nearly ended everything until viktor showed up in this timeline maybe the guilt that someone got killed made him go through with it",
        "gonna need to start a support group for everybody being irreparably down bad after this episode i got all flustered when she showed up i died",
        "powder",
        "heimerdinger the bluegrass folk singer is one of the best parts of this episode",
        "timothe chalamet is gonna kill it playing him in the movie biopic",
        "came here just to mention this why is it that good",
        "and the music i didnt put a heimerdinger musical number on my bingo card and damn it was beautiful also low key  i think jayce got the reality he deserved hes spent rhe whole show up living the high life even as a long time jayce fan seeing him geek out was fun",
        "everyone is powders life is telling her shes holding back i think this powder is gonna use the crystals to rebuild the machine  the final scene she looks at the pendent and crystals and you can tell the wheels are turning and i think heimerdinger will help her he says right before her disappears be back in a jiffy that wasnt a sacrifice and his species apparently cannot die",
        "the cuts back and forth sent me happy dancingsweet romantic moment coral arcane hellscape with jayce climbing floating death rocks",
        "bruh i just saw the scene where shes holding vi wtff",
        "i was gonna go see vi let me guess her grave",
        "the dance scene itself lasted  min and was blurry the whole time tt",
        "need to recreate her outfits and makeup asap fenty should have brought out the altpowder palette i would have paid big bucks",
        "jayces segment was so masterfully directed dialogue was killer such a tight episode god i love it i love it i love it",
        "as a time bomb enjoyer i definitely loved it but it felt too removed from the main story to be a contender for best episode for me\n\nmy favorite is still the last episode but this one is special in its own way",
        "also it seems like when heimer arrived at the au several years before ekko he immediately went to work trying to improve society originally he let piltover and zauns progress stagnate for many years this heimer truly cares about helping others now",
        "this so much this",
        "i dunno about that i imagine if you were in his position this world would feel fake also the fact that he basically overwrote their ekko might gnaw on me",
        "though singed created shimmer its distribution and production are all silcos fault since in that universe vander and him made peace with each other singed lost his sponsor \n\nheimerdinger also said he accomplished a lot in the almost  years he stayed there no doubt he had an influence in helping zaun be independent and peacefu i doubt hed let singed continue his research knowing all the damage shimmer would cause i think singed either accepted his daughters fate or was just straight up arrested",
        "precisely im surprised no one else is talking about this scene and its implications like why would the arcane team go as far as to write this scene go across multiple people make the animation approve it and release it with the episode\n\ni feel like theres more to it and we might see a return of powder in the future in some way shape or form",
        "yordles cant die  hell just respawn  dw",
        "ekko suffered from his own nature he is such an amazing basically uncontainable character that he needed to be kept away for the sake of the plot tasting the good ekkos universe makes it bitter sweet",
        "yeah my boy got a real glowup milo got a yee yee ass moustache instead",
        "literally came here looking for this comment bc im down bad for him lmao",
        "if my understanding of what we say in the previous act is correct then yes we got a very brief glimpse of jayce seeing the people in viktors community as those things so i think that was the connection here jayce is seeing the world if things continue on the path they were on with viktor hextech and the arcane which is why when he comes back he just starts destroying and killing",
        "definitely a bold choice to spend  seasons showing a what if of this terrible timeline where everything goes wrong and all the characters suffer what were those crazy writers thinking",
        "i think jayce can hop with his body because of the rune he got from the mage atleast thats the implication i saw when he asked why they gave them that bracelet",
        "really wish there was more but idk about  episodes",
        "its more of the no hextech thing",
        "you also need to mention how piltover and zaun have brokered peace silco isnt a criminal mastermind both benzo and vander are alive well not to mention claggor and mylo too zaunites are welcomed in piltover as seen from the scene in the bridge where ekko recognizes silcos goons and the guy running a shop in zaun being happy doing business in piltover i also assume zaunite children are able to join the academy since you see some of the kids from zaun watching heimer play in the plaza\n\nso yeah if you take all of that into consideration maybe vi dying is actually the best case scenario for everyone in both cities according to the writers poor vi lmao",
        "also they made a point of vander saying she isnt living up to her potential  i havent seen her so alive as she is while working on your little project",
        "and vander has it on his wrist when we see the flashback of vi and powders mom in the last drop",
        "i think the hooded figure is viktor and the statue holding hextech hammer was that universes jayce who let viktor live but i think the au viktor still has his humanity",
        "i literally cried so hard i threw up i cant believe a show did this to me",
        "yeah i saw that and dont know how to feel theyre basically brothers right",
        "in that timeline they are already together and powder went in for the kiss like she is used to it\n\nfor ekko it was the first time since he was new to the timeline and so he asked her to pretend like it was the first time they ever kissm",
        "i think theyre just meant to be privatepersonal keepsakes while also being a way to communicate to the audience that she still has the gems",
        "my interpretation is she keeps it there cause timetraveling ekko and his vi mural made her realise that in a different timeline vi is alive and its kinda like a happy note in her grief for her sisters death",
        "crazy comment but facts",
        "it is not rushed ekko simply is not that character you expected",
        "its not rushed hes in the middle of the war this season is urgent",
        "theyre unstable this powder makes the right decisions it wouldve had major consequences for their failed experiments",
        "it was jinxs originally she dropped it at the commune viktor picks into up and keeps it until he drops it after being shot by jayce \n\nin his monologue at the end of episode  the gear seems to be representative of the duality of man evil and death vs good and self sacrifice the gear lands on the corrupted side which in my opinion represents viktor loosing his faith in humanity \n\nin episode  it could just be a little reference to the fact it was originally jinxpowders or it could signify ekko regaining his faith in jinx as a contrast to what it represented for viktor",
        "the explosion from the heist in se killed her in the alternative universe",
        "i think timeline diversion happened at jayce home incident so same story",
        "i think thats a vision of the future where victor was let loose",
        "generally if you dont actually see a character die or it isnt confirmed by another character then they arent actually dead",
        "just a personal gift ig but yes ekko gave it to her apparently a blue rose means unattainable love which fits this so much its just a gift that powder put among her personal things",
        "i think powder puts it away because she realized that the ekko who gave it to her was not from her timeline\u00a0\n\niirc she puts it in the drawer of vis altar which to me indicates that she considers it a keepsake  memory from someone who is now gone",
        "haters in shambles",
        "controlled by his trauma i guess",
        "i was thinking that ekkos sense of responsibility is amazing to return to his messed up world vs staying in what seems like a paradise well he said it best that people need him\n\ni would not blame anyone to remain in the dream i just wonder if heimer is dead",
        "i know all i could think the whole episode was how much i wanted him to just stay in his new life and how in his place i never could have left",
        "true but i feel like he was messed up throughout that episode because he knew what happened to silco vander and jinxpowder\n\ni feel like that would be a perpetual mindfuck if he stayed in that universe",
        "and then powder doing her little forehead peace sign with her arm around him geeeeeez",
        "ekkos adoptive father",
        "i dont think its that vi dying cancelled hextech i think jayce died there too and without him there was no push for creating hextech",
        "imma need that adult powder flair asap",
        "me when arcane the show based on league of legends makes a reference to league of legends",
        "like a hamster in a microwave",
        "did it only happen to heimer because his body was weak or would powder have exploded too",
        "crashout of the century",
        "show needs an award for how many people crash out silcos when vi escapes was a good one",
        "yeah hoist your dongers because that boy got fried",
        "i think he just doesnt exist in that timeline or hes been there so long that he merged with his parallel self so the z drive resetting them just makes the donger pop out of existence",
        "in earlier episodes they brought up the theory of arcane only giving energy and life and needing to take energy and life from another source for it\n\ni think for both ekkos to live another life had to be sacrificed  in this case heimers",
        "actually everyone explodes when he rewinds time every time he does it its the physical being being reanimated in their former spot there is no duplicate that can be created because that would become a paradox so it just moves them back to where they were pretty violently",
        "the hat man new league champ \n\nmake it happen riot",
        "yeah i loved this too  its an interesting comparison between healthy ways of coping and unhealthy ways of coping this whole episode made me tear up  definitely one of my favourites if not my favourite of the show so far",
        "yes its not good powder vs evil jinx its the same person that has the potential for both good and evil depending on a few key events in life in that universe her path took a different way that doesnt mean she is a completely different person with a different character",
        "wait which part was it implied",
        "dont forget she also has the hex crystals and ekkos notes\u00a0 so she could herself easily rebuild the zdrive",
        "im with you just passed the ekko and powder dancing and im bawling i needed to take a break before moving forward and grieve more",
        "it does feel like jayce had a lot of empathy moments in this episode or at least two big ones  feel what its like to be crippled the way viktor was  feel what its like to be trapped under ground like zaun",
        "i hate to say it but shes alt not goth goth is a very specific style and powder has never been that emo at most if anything",
        "jayce wasnt he outside of the apartment id assume he probably got a prison sentence andor is making hammers somewhere in piltover why would he be in zaun\n\nor do you mean ekko in which case he clearly was in the universe given that he returned once our ekko left",
        "nah same just finished watching it now and my eyes are puffy and red seeing powder happy and them letting us see how the heist went in this universe fulfilled a gaping hole in my heart",
        "he kind of split apart into heimerpieces when ekko went past  seconds during the test",
        "well first time is when he exploded in front of ekko when they were testing what the limit for the time loop was second time was when he evaporated at the end to recreate the anomaly",
        "time loop he died for a second \npossibly died when exiting the anomaly",
        "makes it even better",
        "a little worried what powder is going to do with those stones though but thats probably going to be left in the realm of fanfic",
        "ekko wakes up at the end hes not dead",
        "i was happy crying during the ekkopowder dance scene and then it cut to jayce just having the worst fucking time i had to laugh at the juxtaposition poor jayce",
        "she also somewhat ironically no longer had vi to compare herself to while certainly sad its easy to argue that no longer living in the shadow of her older sister could have actually helped her mental state in the long run after the grief had passed",
        "totally the silco was a good father to jinx and she always would have ended up like that crowd real quiet right now",
        "especially because she has reason to believe that vi is alive in our ekkos universe she might work on it just to got see vi again",
        "see the thing is she doesnt shut it it hangs on it open before cutting to black",
        "touch",

        "no yeah adult clagget is  percent my type",
        "i thought that at first about claggor and milo but milo was really trying to impress gert at the beginning which isnt to say he isnt bi but i think the simpler answer is theyre good friends personally i prefer this answer because i think this is a great example of physical touch not being unmasculine",
        "right i was like why he even trying to get back just enjoy shit and be happy bro",
        "do you think vi would willingly make that sacrifice if she knew how everyone else would fare in exchange i think so",

        "jesus not just a father figure and the love of your life literally everything that could have been",

        "yeah it obviously was hard to leave behind but it wasnt really his in the first place he was basically stealing the life of that universes him",
        "considering heimerdinger was there for ish years he probably wouldve been fine possessing his alternate self for a good while but ekko has morals so it wouldve been a problem for him morally even if it wasnt a problem physically or dimesnionally",
        "probably silco finally found the letter and they ended up reconnecting at some point",
        "jayce and vi die in the apartment from the power crystals as jinx mentions so no vi no hex gate no war and silco probaly finds the letter",
        "can you explain to me the meaning of this phrase he was saying while he avoided the kiss firstly",
        "ive been eating rainbow iguanas for a month",
        "it would also explain why jayce didnt get sent to that universe  but then again he was also dead in the universe he did get sent to  so i guess the hooded mage really did bring jayce there",
        "it could also just be that his hex crystals killed a child so viktor was a lot less likely to defend his research",
        "au jinx had all the friends ekko vander and a normal silco to lean on",
        "shes still has ptsd seeing his drawings on her book but she had friends in this universe",
        "vi is dead jayce is fucking somewhere i dont know probably dead too\n\n\n\nbut the club is poppin off rn",
        "i was caught offguard by that i was expecting an actual live vi arcane has thrown my media senses completely off",
        "all that matters is that they gave jinx baby bangs and space buns",
        "jayces world is giving both annihilation and phyrexia",
        "deleted",
        "i assume due to vi dying jayce was actually banished andor expelled from the academy so no teaming up with viktor and no hextech breakthrough",
        "i assume zaun did not adopt shimmer as much too due to the absence of hextech the power imbalance between piltover and zaun would be a lot smaller",
        "its not that because the first time she goes for a kiss and ekko rejects at first she says sorry so they hadnt kissed before i think he said can we pretend like its the first time because the first time she went for a kiss he rejected so he didnt want to ruin the moment and wanted it to be like its the first time they attempt to kiss",
        "fr\n\ni love jayce tbh",
        "controlled by literally piltower and zaun would be dead if the hexcore remains",
        "capital h fucking hero everyone else did the thing that intertwined their goals and desires the fucking goat ekko gave up everything to keep fighting the good fight",
        "i thought it was a really philosophical question and a question of responsibility\n\nwould you rather live in a good world knowing its fake to you at least you and one other person being the only two knowing its not the only real\n\nor would you rather live in a fucked up world thats true\n\nalso as ekko said people in his world rely on him",
        "that would explain why he got transported into hell since there was no jayce alive for him to inhabit in the au",
        "i thought that maybe he killed himself like viktor didnt interrupt this time or something",
        "deleted",
        "i saw someone earlier in the thread call it an olympic level crashout and i dont think its getting better than that",
        "im not convinced hes dead i do think they killed the alternate universe heimer but the heimer from the main universe is still alive somewhere similar to how we see ekko separated from his au self at the end",
        "yeah for sure a really beautiful episode that captured the heart of the characters and got to show a different side of them \n\nall while being juxtaposed by some genuinely creepy scenes with jayce",
        "im glad i got the mental illness that makes me an underachieving bartender instead of a genius terrorist myself",
        "the vi doll and they showed she had the book full of drawings that are basically jinxs drawings",
        "omgis this a backstory for how we get jinx in those music videos portaling through dimensions picking up heroes",
        "im fully hoping for a powder show of her travelling through dimensions all to become her own thing and get added as a different champion than jinx\n\nits crazy but if theres a profitable character in lol thats jinx and having two of them while adhering to canon amazing\n\ndelusion is the biggest superpower",
        "jayce wasnt he outside of the apartment\n\nhe was directly outside at the door and got a bit blown away by the explosion but it isnt hard to imagine that in this alternate version the explosion was a bit stronger  the timing a bit different and it just blew up vi and jayce but we dont really know he could just aswell be in prison or banished or whatever",
        "heimerpieces lmao",
        "heimerpieces is vile",
        "yeah i feel that was a pretty clear whelp so much for no hextech in this universe nod",
        "shes the one to discover hextech in this universe but this time she doesnt fuck everything up and everyone lived happily ever after",
        "thats the thing though with the comfort and security of all that healthy love she didnt want to risk any of it i think her life with silco made it so that she was living truly free its destructive and chaotic freedom but she is in a way free",
        "because hes a better man than us willing to sacrifice life in a nicer world to save his own its people like him that zaun and runeterra need",
        "if she could see the future version of events where her sister turned into jinx and everything from our timeline happened knowing her life was the key yes she would sacrifice herself in a heartbeat to give her sister a better life remember when she said i want powder to have more than that",
        "he isnt the main character but he feels like the protagonist hes just that heroic",
        "powder went in for the kiss as ekko in that universe was her boyfriend  ekko of our timeline always had a crush on jinx but they became enemies so thats why he tells powder to take it slow cause it would be his first time kissing her\n\nor it could be interpreted as him hesitating cause they were enemies before so its kind of an instinct\n\ni prefer the former explanation",
        "also i think the reason why jayce didnt have his soul transferred is because the future jayce is already dead as shown when he reached the top",
        "or possibly even just decided the research was too dangerous and stopped on his own after seeing someone die because of it",
        "he may also have died in the explosion that killed au vi",
        "in this episode he really became the man of tomorrow",
        "sometimes taking a step forward means leaving a few things behind",
        "except it wasnt a fake or illusion or anything it was completely real which makes him having the strength to go back even more admirable",
        "i actually always assumed that the being gripping the hammer was that timelines jayce  or rather what happened to him at the end of viktors evolution hence why its posed a bit like him",
        "im not even a league fan and i was popping off at the references to the game i understood throughout the act",
        "i assume because hes dead in the happy timeline he didnt have a body to transport into like heimerdinger and ekko",
        "also known as dingers",
        "jinx wasnt free she was shackled by the memories of her dead family and her guilt towards them she states many times that she thinks she has to be the way she is crazy violent etc because theres no way for her to change thats part of her and vis whole conflict how is she free\n\nand even separate from that it seemed like ekko and vander were convincing her to be more free anyway",
        "i hope nobody here would kill their alternate selves in another dimension just because your own dimension is worse",
        "yeah i think because ekko assumed in that universe they kissed many times we can understand they were a couple also by the friends comments like what would you do without her he asked her to pretend it was their first time very sweet",
        "i think this is the much more likely answer vander dying was almost expected he was the face of half of zaun but vi was still a young teenager at the time that kind of death will resonate with people more",
        "its real in the meaning of it being another reality\n\n  \nits not real in the meaning of it being his life",
        "i mean yes its literally his hammer that was being held but he ended up in a different alt universe from the one they were talking about ekko ended up in the jayce died so everyone could be happy timeline and jayce ended up in the you fucked everything up timeline",
        "his alternate self didnt die in the process",
        "hell it even shocked marcus and prefatherhood marcus too that really hammered home what an impact this event would have had on everyone involved\n\nand to think even in this timeline jayce still got to accidentally kill a kid and be eaten up by guilt he never misses a chance"

        "i was so happy for caitxvi they earned this caitlyn telling vi that she knew vi would try to break jinx out and planned for it was peak its not a wonder it totally disarmed vi its really important to note that this is the first time theyve been able to reconcile since their violent breakup one of the first things that caitlyn does is forgive vi unconditionally for making the choice that vi always thought was wrong she still wants cait but her duty is to her sister cait finally understands that and now vi knows\n\na cait isnt trying to hunt down jinx anymore\n\nb isnt going to be mad at vi for picking jinx\n\nvi finally doesnt have to choose shes finally free to love and be loved and not constantly be torn between the girl she wants and the sister she loves yeah bitch was hongry shes had this emotion bottled up inside of her for months she finally got to let it all out",

        "might get some flack but honestly i loved the scene with cait and vi and i dont think it was too wild or rushed \n\nthat said i think your enjoyment of it hinges on if you think vi believes jinx is suicidal or if shes just going to the under city to be the unhinged jinx vi meets in season \n\nfor me i dont think vi knows that jinx is going to end her life just that shes going to break the cycle whatever that implies vi went there to get jinx out so that she specifically can help in the fight that imo is somewhat delusional on vi but represents her character believing in the good for those she loves and that they will choose to do good but it also tells me she has blinders on and doesnt see the pain jinx is inwhich makes me think she doesnt realize jinx is suicidal\n\nthe conversation vi has with cait leading up to it is very telling vi says that she chose wrong again that she really thought jinx was going to help and that vi always chooses wrong and that by doing so she ends up losing everyone here she chose wrong by thinking jinx would help and in the moment she thinks that decision caused her to lose both jinx and cait shes expecting cait to yell at her  be upset at her and for jinx to not help  disappear into the under city \n\ncait basically tells her that she knew vi would try this that she pulled all the guards out of the jail to let her do it and in a way is kind of saying that vi did not choose wrong and also did not lose cait i think in that moment vi realizes that cait has both forgiven jinx to whatever level she did and is acknowledging her feelings here is something that vi wont lose and i think the emotions of it overwhelm her and they have sex",

        "to everyone who believes that the caitvi sex scene is out of place  here are my thoughts on it\n\nright before they kiss caitlyn basically tells vi i knew what you were going to do and i helped you do it despite you lying to me again because your happiness is more important than my revenge \n\nthats all vi has ever wanted from anyone and especially from cait their scene was a long time coming and vi finally got what she needed from caitlyn to feel like they could go there\n\nin regards to the comments about it being done in the place where her sister was in pain and held captive  jinx locked her in that cell at this point vi has given up on jinx or at least is listening to jinx when she says she doesnt want to be saved after what vi has been through to try and get her sister back i think her resignation from the fight at this point makes sense ive seen people say she shouldve been going after her but when has that ever been successful for vi if jinx doesnt want to be found she wont be and vi knows that\n\nadditionally i think the prison is the perfect scene caitlyn met vi for the first time when she was behind bars and it was really full circle to see caitlyn join her in there instead of releasing her and to see vi actually take control of a situation that she wants to happen she always chooses wrong but in this moment she chooses caitlyn\n\nfinally  theyre both fucked up individuals who have made wrong choices and are experiencing trauma let them have sex in a prison cell for crying out loud theyre about to go to war they cant be picky",

        "im happy we got that caitvi scene but does anyone feel like it was kind of misplaced like idk i feel like vi wouldve gotten the hint jinx was going through it especially after how she witnessed jinx losing isha etc and not necessarily a betrayal when jinx pushed and locked her in the cell instead and wouldve been more anxious as to where she went rather than yk eating out the cupcake lol\n\nbut anyway they really did it in a cell",

        "for the gifted arrogance is the ultimate threat\nmy favorite line of the episode  though it had some competition \n\nespecially as the conversation between mel and the unknown mage goes to how their efforts to turn ambessas course has not been fruitful  its how they view ambessa the mages probably helped her earlier thinking she was an ally until they ironically changed course to thinking she was a threat\n\nedit who decides who gets a second chance might be a close contender for a favorite quote but that opens a whole can of worms and maybe thats why it cuts so deep",
        "super saiyan mel\n viktor said it again\n quite a tense fight between cait and vi huh\n viktor said it again x\n aw man it hurts to see jinx like that \n vi has never given up on jinxpowder  but seriously someone hug vi she has the weight of the world on her shoulders\n fuck yeah sex scene long live these lesbians on a prison cell huh kinky\n i dont fucking care hell yeah go girl\n vander \n\ndamn this episode was tense you can feel the build up im not ready",
        "what does cait mean when she told vi you really think i needed guards at the hexgates sorry to say but youre predictable i need an explanation lol",
        "what did cait mean by do you think i needed all those guards at hexgates",
        "eating pussy is canon",
        "some of yall never thought you made a stupid decision and lost everyone because of it only to be greeted with open arms by a person you love and also are insanely attracted to and it shows",
        "holy shit they actually did it",
        "i was confused whether if i was watching an episode of s of arcane because a musical montage hadnt hit and then the sex scene happened",
        "jail sex",
        "ok so what did cait mean with you really think i needed all my soldiers at the hex gates im confused",
        "seeing the last remnants of vander fade away was gutwrenching",
        "was was the lesbian sex scene really that important to the plot\n\n\napparently yes",
        "that sex scene was utter peak",
        "man the art feels like its gone up a notch it just continues to astound me \n\nalso man they made mel such a cutie",
        "this is way too rushed mel just drank lbs koolaid without comment then trekked across the continent back home jayce and mel just take back their positions in the council despite being awol for a long time ambessa lost half her iq and believes that viktor can actually be controlled and will work for her cait just lets jinx out despite hearing her admit she would have fired the rocket even if she knew that caits mom was there anyway\n\nthis really should have been three seasons instead maybe show the apocalyptic bad end in season  before jayce is sent back in season  to fix it",
        "viktor starting the manipulation",

        "i love how this episode split the fanbase right down the middle between what does it all mean what are their plans and holy hell and here i was thinking the kiss is all we get",
        "jayce a real chad",
        "the ep was fine generally speaking i think the the creators knew that if there was no caitvi sex scene then the lesbians would rise up against them and as sex scenes go there were pros and cons pros  plenty of small things that reflected actual wlw sex gestures timing eye contact order of actions it felt human and i was pleased they finally got on with it however cons  is poor vi doomed to only have sex in cells jesus and yeah the king princess song was overwhelming we could have had them make a little noise themselves before the kp vocals took over",
        "jinx is going to kill herself and vi initiates sex with caitlyn what the fuck is this man they could have the sex scene in any other situation ya ass writing",

        "does anyone know what caitlyn is referring to when she says you really think i needed all the guards at the hexgates sorry to say but youve grown a bit predictable\n\ni think its just me missing something or not being able to recall what she is talking about rn the line just feels kind of random to me",
        "this was brilliant but also im so confused what happened",
        "i have so many thoughts so ill just fire them out here\n\n\n seeing the contrast between altjinx last episode and jinx now is soul crushing the facade is completely gone all thats left is the broken girl i also love the detail that altjinx or alt powder i should say kept her hair short while jinxs hair is so long covering and consuming her they do say hair holds memories so we can see her hair is a physical manifestation of the traumas shes faced and paths shes been down also i related so hard to that thing with her nails bleeding lol\n\n\n im glad we had last episode because now i can fully understand jayces motivations and im glad hes finally putting an end to the chaos he caused i do still empathise with victor we saw how peaceful and welloff his followers were but now we can understand the price of that their humanity also yessss they let jayce keep the beard\n\n\n i wasvery confused by mels opening like ok shes a mage and the black rose want to recruit her and taking the necklace meant she was accepting her identity but then the witch girl said it was something she couldnt return from but also her blood is alien to her and the black rose thinks ambessa purposely hid her to use her as a weapon but then ambessa said it was to protect her i dont know who to believe anymore\n\n\n that said i like the conformation that mel did indeed save herself and jayce dont let cait find out about that i do also sympathise with the way ambessa is clearly grieving her son if in an unhealthy way shes a mamma bear on the attack but like silco said killing is a cycle\u00a0\n\n\n vi had me in tears the way she clings to jinx refuses to give up on her all us older sisters in the room felt that in our souls and i love the characterisation that she feels she also makes the wrong choices something vander warned her against all those years ago it sucks because we can clearly see how she spent so long making decisions based on how she could help and protect others she compromises her own integrity and morals to do what she thinks is right for her family and friends and thats her fatal flaw as vander said in episode  sometimes you have to pour your own cup\n\n\n catvi returns wowowowow i have to commend the writers and the vas for doing such and incredible job i loved seeing how cait was willing to sacrifice her own desire for revenge for vis sake for her happiness shes truly turned a corner and dont we just love when romantic couples learn from their mistakes and improve for the best best part for me was cait trying to tell her about maddie and vi just not giving a shit lol a woman after my own heart caitvi is definitely up there as one of the best wlw onscreen ships ever i feel like we rarely see this kind of cathartic and moving moments for wlw relationships some im so glad to see were making moves in that department\n\n\n rip vander no notes the visualisation of the watercolour memories that almost brought him back burning away was absolutely shattering\n\n\n animation superb voiceacting incredible music heartbreaking and beautiful a top tier episode imo",
        "immediately peeped the season  episode  parallel of vi turning around in the exact same way when she heard the keys as she did when they first met in the stillwater cell\n\nthey aint that slick",
        "man i just really need to talk about this caitvi scene  did anyone actually enjoy it  and if so can you tell me what you liked about it\n\nfor me this show has always been first and foremost about jinx and vi and their relationship as sisters  id understand vi caring more about caitlyn than jinx at the beginning of this season  but here in episode  vi has acknowledged that jinx is turning a new leaf and believes she can do good things\n\nthen she sees the state jinx is in and jinx basically tells her shes going to end her own life and vis first thought upon being released is to bang caitlyn\n\ni just dont get it  does vi not realize what jinx is going to do  does she not care  or is there some third reason im missing  because im not satisfied with either of those explanations  someone please tell me im missing something\n\nive never hated vi during the course of arcane  everything she did up until now was understandable and human  but this i just dont get it",
        "im going to cry theres a good version of you in there jinx dont go and leave vi locked up",
        "on behalf of cait and vi thank you arcane writers",
        "the animators always go all out with mel thank you",
        "thank you vis biceps for gracing us this day",
        "they are doing a good job of creating the sense of dread before war",

        "once again caitlyn getting vi out of a jailcell killing might be a cycle but so is love lol",
        "say gex",
        "okay the sex scene was hot but no one is talking about vander hes gone my boy is gone",
        "magic mel  her transformation is sick i like exiled heir tasked w killing your parent arc with her too v shakespearean",
        "sesbian lex",
        "all i could say was do they actually have time to be doing this right now",
        "oh they fuckin on here",
        "im just mad that jayce got sick ass pumps into mel and while the cell scene with vi and cait was steamy it wasnt enough like i need more i get the whole they wouldve lost the game rating had they released the extended version but its just not sitting right with me",
        "i really feel like the sex scene couldve waited til after the war they were in the middle of lol",
        "why did msyoung say no you wont to viktor can someone explain",
        "i enjoyed the scene with vi and caitlyn but the music was so corny i just dont think it matched the vibe properly if i had to choose i would go for a more electric vibe kind of like cool for the summer this song specifically gives me lesbian vibes but i feel like a song similar to this would have fit the scene better especially because caitlyn was cheating on maddie im probably being a bit dramatic",
        "as much as i hope ambessa gets hit by a train the animators did an exceptional job showing her pain when she spoke on her son\u00a0watercolours burning away as vander gets robotified was also a killer twist of the knife\u00a0\n\n\nbut fuck man this pacing is killing me scenes never get to breathe characters break their motivations in service to driving the plot forward its all so nonsensical\u00a0\n\n\nand what sucks the most is the story is so freaking good if they told this exact same story but over  or  seasons holy crap itd be one of the best animated series ever made",
        "i really wish could remember anything in this episode other than caitvi sex scene haha i felt like a guard taking a sneak at these two getting freaky",
        "cait vi sex scene  ohhhhhh",
        "fantastic act so far im dreading this final episode\n\nalso the finale appears to be only  mins including credits per interviews it was over an hour initially wtf man they couldnt give us another  mins at least to make it an hour \n\ni hate executives and stupid choices from creators no one has ever wanted a shorter finale in the history of television",
        "wait warwick cant be dead right right",
        "just one big hint for this episode   \nviktor we lost ourselves lost our dream in the pursuit of great we failed to do good arcane season one episode",
        "how to overcome traumas \n\n  \n sekkkk",
        "so where did skye go you think does she still exist did she ever exist or was it just victor talking to something he projected",
        "im confused  can someone explain viktors goals the hexgates jayces corruption etc mel what exactly happened",
        "why am i barely seeing people talk about vander i had to pause during that scene so i didnt sob lmao",
        "jinx says to caitlyn i didnt know your mom was there in regards to blowing up the council at the end of s still confused what was jinxs motivation in blowing that council up because in s it doesnt feel like she gained anything in return",
        "lesbian sex awww but the show is fucking fire",
        "is it just me or did it seem like jayce was trying to pin the blame on viktor when jayce had said this was your obsession what you did to these people you did on your own or something along the lines of that im a little confused on where to stand was he only referring to viktors quest to become jesus or was he talking about hextech in general because everything really traces back to jayce if were being honest he was the one that essentially turned viktor into what he is now plus hextech was his invention to begin with and he kept going even after being warned by his mentor who he banished shortly after\n\nedit he was talking about his jesus quest i think",
        "but im not quite understand caitlyns line you really think i needed all the guards at the hexgates  seriously i still not get it could anyone help me out of this",
        "yeah this final act is rushed lol\n\nstill enjoying but man i feel like this need  episodes to flesh it out a little bit more idk",
        "if youre a\n\nlesbian and youre watching the caitvi scene on x speed on repeat to catch all the details\n\n clap your hands",
        "wild hair jinx is a look",
        "well viktors storyline doesnt imply good things for an ekko saviour moment doesnt completely make it impossible but not looking good",

        "wait so can anyone explain what cait did did she intentionally leave no guards stationed at jinxs cell so she could escape im confused",
        "i hope to see fanart that continues where they cut off with vi and caitlyn i feel bad for maddie though",
        "what does killing is a cycle mean",
        "pacing of this episode seems off",
        "vi and cait",
        "to be honest her line i cant be happy or what it was after episode  was brutal",
        "i cant believe the next one will be the last episode of this marvelous series",
        "did that cell scene just happen",
        "so we can have a lesbian sex scene but we cant see jayce rearranging viktors insides like a rubiks cube\n\nwe used to be a proper country",
        "i might be alone in this but the amount of songs theyre using is excessive instead of using lyrical music there needs to be instrumentals in here these episodes are just music videos",
        "deleted",
        "glorious evolution he said the thing again guys",
        "time stamp for vicait",

        "damn",
        "jayce becoming jon snow huh",
        "caitvi truthers were right omg they did have lesbian sex huh",
        "after watching the whole episode  i finally realized that the whole season  and  was built for that one sex scene between cait and vi in the cell because after the whole sequels all i remember is those two taking each others clothes off and start caressing for  seconds\n\nthats the strongest memory that i can recall after watching those last  episodes of season",
        "very stupid question why ambessa and viktor need to go to the anamoly he evolved tons of soldier for her already and he is still alive",
        "did jinx swallow the hextech crystal in order to get it into the prison cell and then spit it up if so why so she could use it later in her bomb similar to isha",
        "i cant help but feel mel has become a living chekhovs gun now\n\nalso i expected the violyn scene at some point but that is definitely a place to put it these are literally the last episodes so they had to put it somewhere a little awkward as a viewer but i vibed with the song",
        "ambessa think this through if he does what you ask they wont be your soldiers anymore theyll be his",
        "can someone explain what happen to heim is he dead or just stuck in that other universe",
        "can someone explain the following what is viktor looking at or what distracts him from killing jayce at",
        "it looked more like water dropping onto it like someone crying aka me",
        "omg vi dropped to her knees cuz heavy is the crown \n\nb r a v o fortiche",

        "cant believe they made a two season tv show just to introduce the new champion lmao",

        "i am so in love with jinx with hair down wish they would have kept it but it makes sense she lost isha who was a weird plot device imo but whatever she lost silco she thought she would always be a burden and her hair probably reminded her of all of that hair carries memories or something like that",
        "sure hope it doesnt awaken anything in me",
        "she had a medusa vibe in some frames",
        "i had to pause to write that down this episode had a lot of good writing",
        "and yet she clearly did lament was shocked to see the tears in her eyes a great character no doubt",

        "he was in  episodes",
        "and she just dove back in and they addressed the maddie situation in just two lines of dialogue that was perfectly done im not even gonna lie",
        "its probably the first sex scene ive ever seen that actually felt more romantic than sexual i know im alone there ha ha",
        "many people did as well",
        "he gets attack speed on ranged attacks",
        "i do think he needs training but it makes sense for now since he really was never a real fighter like when chainsaw mum showed up at the memorial his first thought was to run even after he partially blinded her with her chemicals and then picked up a tiny hammer hit her once and then dropped it and ran away when hitting her once didnt work \n\n\nits clear he needs intensive combat training hahaha",
        "i wonder if now that viktor is gone he will revert back to the wolfy version and regain some of the memories\n\ni know he survived ishas bomb had  gems jinxs only  besides there is an orange streak along with jinxs puple one",
        "absolutely devastating dude did not deserve any of that",
        "yeah this right here its still so sad that his memories were burning away slowly ugh he was put through so much too i feel like",
        "vanders story may be the saddest in the whole series",
        "i audibly shouted no when it happened it had me fucked up",
        "maybe he meant the voices in his head",
        "in jayces defense its not paranoid schizophrenia if the voices really are out trying to kill you",
        "",
        "right im like mel you dummy that could be a trap",
        "its where they first met after all",
        "vi and cait just upped the hair game for their big moment",
        "lol  what are you guys  some sort of league of legends",
        "a league of extraordinary gentlemen",
        "gifgiphylejxoqzbaxsd\n\nthe sex sceeeeeneee the sex sceneee is real",
        "something that really hit me was that unlike claggor or mylo silco never taunted jinx he taught her lessons and cared for her in jinxs mind even in death it just shows how much he meant to jinx and how much losing him left a hole in her",
        "in my opinion silco is literally the difference in quality between s and s s is still excellent dont get me wrong but silco is the best character in the show and you feel it when hes not always around",
        "okay but can i say that the back tattoo looks absolutely gorgeous",
        "fuck that line changed my brain chemistry",
        "its hard to say personally i took it as the last remnant of sky judging viktor she sees him giving up too much to achieve his goals the ends no longer justify the means",
        "i think sky sort of represented victors remaining sense of humanity and his conscience viktor lived a hard life but always tried to do what was good after his commune failed and he became corrupted he went fully off the deep end and came to the conclusion that removing emotions and individuality were the only path forward for humanity him getting rid of sky can be seen as him reaching evil nirvana the last vestiges of his own humanity gone sky said you wont because its true he is not longer a person but the glorious evolution incarnate he no longer has a need for lesser things like a conscience or humanity it also might have been a bit of a fuck you because she tried so hard to stop him from going down this path but failed",
        "i caught that too its like they really wanted to show us how hot she is",
        "yes i guess us caitvi shippers are in a dual mind loved the scene on one hand but not the right time and place after what jinx said what she said",
        "i view it as desperate distracting sex not as romancy more like two broken people trying to support each other",
        "deleted",
        "lol i was thinking the same thing throughout the entire sex scene i was like uhhh vi your little sister kinda needs you right now",
        "yeah the context totally soured the scene and i dont have a super positive opinion about it despite very much rooting for caitvi all season",
        "yeah same  i didnt read the leaks but from everyones reaction i guess they were right  this is really weird and i dont feel good about it  im gonna wait a day or so to watch the finale because this episode has me in the wrong headspace  this is a really weird direction theyre taking with these characters",
        "its the hair",
        "the high waisted pants and the crop top jacket were fire",
        "i was prepared for a righteous lecture from sky but looks like she knew viktors too far gone already",
        "can someone explain whats vicktor new mindset and why he chose war sorry but i cant understand at all",
        "as she should",
        "that was so funny she tried so hard to curb his worst impulses and then when she realized she lost the fight she just said youre a psycho and im out of here",
        "shes implying she allowed vi to make it all the way to jinx with the keys and she was able to do because she was able to predict that vi would do exactly that",
        "she sent the guards away so they could have prison cell bunker sex while jinx kills herself s",
        "how the fuck did it even get leaked",
        "who said that to whom again \n\nvi to cait and you mean now that vi ate her cupcake",
        "to be honest im seeing more of caitvi twitter complaining aboutr the locationtiming",
        "the straights got timebomb last episode a super cute and wholesome romance\n\nthe gays get dirty grimy lesbian sex in a jail cell\n\narcane truly understands its core audience and what they want",
        "them bitches gay\n\ngood for them good for them",
        "shes a certified muscle mommy i envy cait and i envy vi at the same time",
        "tbh i still havent understood nothing about his arc this season \n\nsame for jayce",
        "so did jayce actually set things in motion then its like a time loop if hadnt killed vic things wouldnt have gone the way it went",
        "ngl i feel bad for her",
        "maddie knew immediately she stood by that door as soon as vi entered the room",
        "in fairness this season does have the sex trigger warnings haha",
        "whats crazy is that caitlyn takes it off herself  with her hands crossed",
        "dude theres like a million violent scenes and youre worried about some sex",
        "after just being told by her sister that shes probably committing sudoku lmao",
        "ah yes denting blows proc during sex",
        "very much so hahah",
        "i dont think vi even understood what jinx meant by ending the cycle tbh",
        "it is not at the moment god only knows how much time has passed between jinx escapade and cait encountering vi in the cell she may had enough time to digest the initial feelihg more than that vi was thinking cait would be mad at her and all that grief mixed with the relief in cait being ok with her is a nice setup for the good old makeup sex",
        "this was foreshadowed in season  episode  where claggor ate a cupcake",
        "vi spent most of her late teens through her midtwenties in prison its absolutely not her first time having sex in a jail cell haha",
        "wow exactly this totally agree",
        "omgg you described it so well i feel like there was a lot of build up for this scene like the stakes are so high and theres a lot of tension starting from the first season\n\nespecially because due to the constant fighting they never really got to be together i really loved the way it went i also really appreciate that it wasnt shortened cuz i notice shows tend to cut down the time frame forlgbtlesbian sex scenes in comparison to straight ones but they didnt do that",
        "black rose knows what theyre doing with the fit lol",
        "it has been driving me crazy that i cant find anyone remarking on this ive watched so many reactions and i dont understand like its right there jesus",
        "my interpretation is that in this moment viktor is abandoning the last part of humanity in him i dont know if sky is real or not but it was absolutely beautiful symbolism",
        "say gex",
        "the way i screamed that mask was everything",
        "well tbf they were indeed murmuring which when youre upset can be equally as annoying as having full conversations lol",
        "hahahaha ya wtf was that",
        "totally i read it as vi recognizing that caitlyn sees her fully and that she is no longer the revengedriven caitlyn from a few months prior theres nothing more attractive than someone you love really seeing you",
        "you hit the nail on the head my friend\n\nthats exactly how i read the scene too jinx literally tells vi to be happy and be with kait as well",
        "i dont know didnt felt right to me especially since jinx just went to god knows where and the sad thing is she tried to ff herself\nimagine having crippling depression and you meet your sister for one last time and your sister has the most wild sex the second you leave\n\ni dont know what to feel anymore",

        "right before they kiss caitlyn basically tells vi i knew what you were going to do and i helped you do it despite you lying to me again because your happiness is more important than my revenge\n\nalmost like she killed the cycle of vengeance by finally deciding to make a different decision",
        "a perfect interpretation \n\n\nthis is how i interpret is aswell when vi said she lost everyone including cait because she always choose jinx as a mistake on her part cait implied no you did not lose me i even helped you to free your sis\u00a0\n\n\nthats when hope came back to her soul\n\n\nthats why when cait telling her about maddie she didnt gave a damn about a small fling cait choosing her is more than enough to vi because vi knew she done more hurtful things to cait by choosing jinx",
        "i knew there was going to be a sex scene and i wondered where the setting would be for some reason caits bedroom didnt feel right i think it wouldnt have given the right balance between the two of them \nso when it happened at the prison cell it made sense to me it mirrored the first time cait and vi met and i think its beautiful\nalso yes seeing vi taking control and confidently asking for what she wants is so satisfying to see",
        "ok yeah you mentooned all of my gripes about it and this helps thanks",
        "thanks for the analysis the prison choice makes more sense and its interesting \n\ni still have an issue with the choices of shots and music they used in the actual sex scene it felt out of tone with the show and a bit forcedcringe for some reason and im saying this as a gay woman who loves their relationship",
        "also would love to get conflicting opinions on this  the scene is very important to me and im very interested to hear any thoughts good or bad",
        "omg thank you sm for the break down icl there were def some aspects i was confused about even tho i still loved it but now it feels completely different and so much more touching since that i get it really beautiful scene",
        "ukarolmsandford exactly im a little shocked that people doesnt feel that this scene has great emotional meaning several meanings tbh",
        "vi deserves it after last episode showing that everyone lived and the city found peace if she had died",
        "nah vi just confessed that she feels she lost everyone and caitlyn reassured her that she hasnt lost her that she knows her well enough to prepare for what she will do and be able to support her and in a time of distress she still has comfort physical intimacy can also be a form of comfort and emotional release as well as reclaiming a sense of power",
        "haha i thought the same if i were vi i would be more worried about where my sister went after saying the things she said major red flag stuff\n\nwhile i really really really loved the scene  years wait was worth it damn it maybe not the right time and place vi could have controlled her hunger but i guess she reaaallly wanted that  asap  \n\nside note jinx with her hair down wow",

        "she knew vi would try to break jinx out and basically left the door open for them",

        "i liked it \n\ncouple things \n\nfirst i dont think vi knows that jinx is going to end her life just that shes going to break the cycle whatever that implies vi went there to get jinx out so that she specifically can help in the fight that imo is somewhat delusional on vi but represents her character believing in the good for those she loves and that they will choose to do good but it also tells me she has blinders on and doesnt see the pain jinx is inwhich makes me think she doesnt realize jinx is suicidal\n\nsecond quite a bit of time passes from when jinx gets freed to when vi gets freed whats she going to do immediately chase after someone shes had a hard time finding\n\nlast the conversation she has with cait leading up to it is very telling vi says that she chose wrong again that she really thought jinx was going to help and that vi always chooses wrong and that ends up causing her to lose everyone here she chose wrong by thinking jinx would help and in the moment she thinks that decision caused her to lose both jinx and cait shes expecting cait to yell at her  be upset at her and for jinx to not help  disappear into the under city \n\ncait basically tells her that she knew vi would try this that she pulled all the guards out of the jail to let her do it and in a way is kind of saying that vi did not choose wrong and also did not lose cait i think in that moment vi realizes that cait has both forgiven jinx to whatever level she did and is acknowledging her feelings \n\nin the end i think the enjoyment of the scene will hinge on whether or not you think vi realized jinx was suicidal vs just going back to being the unhinged jinx she first met",
        "just going with the feeling of the moment it was freaking cathartic caitlyn and vi have largely gone without doing anything strictly for themselves or for each other caitlyn is upholding justice for the dead at the expense of her personal wellbeing and this potential relationship vi is still fighting and pushing on her sisters behalf to try to help her and also further change her theyve pretty much been able to be in love without actually doing most of the things people in love get to do instead theyve almost always been fighting battles in one form or another this time they took a break from their obligations to their families cities etc and did something for themselves for a change i loved it",
        "blame the pacing but i will try to explain what happened\n\neveryone in runaterra knows that vi chasing after jinx is just spiraling into madness for both of them the only one who doesnt realizes it is vi herself\n\ncaitlyn made a way that vi could release jinx and she knew she would just escapethis is cait realization of jinx changing jinx left vi to make her happy\n\nnow vi just dropped the shacle of burdens that she carried in her entire life and for once was not worried about her sister because she realized too that it is useless to chase her over and over again \n\nthen feelings happen  sesbian lex",
        "i dont disagree with what youre saying but this logic makes the assumption that vi understood what jinx meant by ending the cycle i dont believe that vi would have jumped to that conclusion",
        "she said she is gonna end the cycle vi probably did not get what she was meaning cause powder had a convo with silco in her head before that",
        "i actually enjoyed it though i definitely dont blame the people who felt it was overlong vi said it herself shes at the end of the rope and has fucked up just about everything good in her life she doesnt even want to go after jinx in this state as she cant see any outcome other than failure the same as it went with caitlyn caitlyn is also in the throes of some pretty intense emotion as its essentially the night before the battle for all of piltover which she is in charge of this scene serves for both of them releasing their respective tensions as well as reminding vi that while she might make mistakes she can be forgiven and keep moving forward remember caitlyn and jinxs convo about forgiveness this is essentially bringing both of their internal conflicts to a close before the final battle\u00a0\nnot trying to convince you to like the scene but that was my read on it",
        "yeaaa i dont think theres really an explanation beyond just being happy they finally had sex tbh it made no sense to happen right there and was incredibly out of character and i think the only reason it did was because the writerseditors did not find another place to put it in since there was only  episodes left by that point",
        "this show at its core is about humanity the two side of a coin and love \n\nsex is one of those things that connect us to another human \n\nvi and cait are humans that have been denying themselves this part of themselves knowing that there is this big battle on the horizon would you not take this chance to make love with someone i sure as hell would",
        "i was thinking the same thing i feel like the jayce x mel scene was way longer and if im not mistaken the producers only make one cut so they wouldnt have been able to push our girls scene for too long without it getting banned in most of the world then again they spent a historic budget so maybe they did do different takes for a global audience",

        "the way i interpreted it is that viktor realised that human emotions are whats causing all the violence in the world and his goal is now to rid everyone of their humanity and make them evolve past it thats also why sky said he wouldnt miss their conversations because he would no longer feel anything",
        "yes can someone explain please jayce killed him now all of a sudden he alive again whilst he was dying he spoke about the doctor was right right about what now not only is he alive again but gone completely opposite of all things peace and healing then he had the audacity to come back to jayce asking for them to work on his mission together like please can someone tell me what exactly vicktor mission is because now im beyond confused",
        "basically victor is trying to save humanity by erasing emotions and individuality because from his perspective its the only way for humanity not to destroy itself his conversationfight with jayce showed him that there is some resistance to this idea when victor told singed to begin the procedure he was giving the ok to weaponize the hive to put it another way victor is launching a preemotive apocalypse hes going to assimilate humanity and from his perspective rid it over its worse base instincts so that humanity doesnt wipe itself out later",

        "damn ekko having to rewind to talk jinx off the ledge thats a saw wound fuck",
        "its so funny how people thought that sevika will die but in the end everyone died except her lol",
        "ekko is the goat and his back must hurt from carrying the good guys so much",
        "singed gets the best ending lmao",
        "bro the entire arcane story is because of viktor wtf",
        "that little bitch maddie omg actually thought caitlyn was dying right then and there",
        "damn a lot of maddie haters suddenly feeling really justified right now lol\n\ni did appreciate your warmth now thats cold",
        "rip loris we hardly knew you",
        "unfortunately i have to give ambessa her credit for being the coldest motherfucker on the battlefield",
        "to me the last scenes kinda indicate that jinx actually made it out caitlyn looking at the map of the exact same tower and the air systems she holds a piece of jinxs gadgets in her hand and smiles a bit while looking at map of the tower seems she realized jinx might have made it out then we see the airship and the the end screen with the effects you usually saw in jinxs scenes for example when her psychosis kicked in thats how i intepret the ending which yes shes my favorite character and i hope thats what the ending means  whats do you guys think about it\u00a0\n\n\nedit\u00a0caitlyn sees the blueprints while having the rest of jinxs bomb in her hand maybe she looked for her i think the next hint is caitlyns look after vi told her im the dirt under your fingernails nothing willcan clean me out basically she says theyll be together unless jinx is alive and right before the scene switches to the airship you see the close up cam on caitlyns she knows that their happy time is over once vi finds out theres hope for jinx being alive shed go searching asap",
        "i really dig how they chose to adapt viktors lol look he looks almost like a fallen angel the guy went from arcane jesus to arcane satan real quick\n\nand the entrance of his minions dear lord i got smile  flashbacks there",
        "i cant believe singed got everything he wanted with zero consequences for all the shit he did shimmer turning vander into warwick working with ambessa and reviving viktor which led to the battle",
        "maddie you litle",
        "there is no way jinx is dead bro\n\nedit seems like she is alive cait is looking at a map of pathways and system inside the hexgate where jinx fell into then after that you can see airship which is jinx driving powder said in s she will one day fly away in one of those things and then you can see the text the end with jinx style",
        "kinda wild that i thought episode  was the best and most well paced episode of the whole season lol",
        "i find it funny that viktor ended up experimenting on which rune to give jayce",
        "the humanity and compassion that jayce can bring out in viktor even after all theyve been through fucking hurts man they meant so much to each other and are literally soulbound that last shot of them touching foreheads was beautiful and made me tear up tbh whether you shipped them or not what mattered was knowing they truly cared for each other through thick and thin\n\nwith all the lore arcane gave us it gives so much more complexity to their ingame interactions",
        "in the pursuit of great we failed to do good is a hell of an understatement victor",
        "hey sevika hope you get a line",
        "i feel absolutely insulted by viktors final form how it carries his human face cut in half  a constant reminder of his lovable human self that just turned into a carcass of whatever the fck that evil jesus was \n\nthank you ekko and jayce for destroying that abomination\n\ncharacterdesign wise its cool tho",
        "damn i was hoping for a more complete ending since they are moving on from arcane everything seems to be heading for noxus but i doubt they would be in that show\n\ni guess we can assume that jinx is still alive and vi and cait are looking for her but that seems difficult to follow up on unless they are main characters in whatever the next series are crazy that they still killed off some league champs though",
        "eyepatches are known to be aphrodisiacs",
        "rip to loris he was a real one till the end\n\ngifgiphyxzbpbiqcqpfdkxsi",
        "boy saviour gonna boy saviour",
        "if its supposed to be jinx in that airship at the end where tf is she going lol",
        "really unsure whether it was necessary to go into the battle for humanity direction ep  was perfect because of focus and simplicity i feel like keeping things small makes it easier to present those wonderful character interaction scenes",
        "the entire thing with jayce and viktor i literally could not stop thinking about how similar yet different it was to vander and silco yet in the end viktor does the right thing and saves everyone by dying with jayce a contradictory to season  where vander practically begs silco to do the right thing yet he doesnt  it really was a full circle moment",
        "the cut from the council table directly to midwar vi carrying someone behind her back was crazy work loved it",
        "so\n\njayce and viktor unknownarcane bullshit\n\nheimer dead\n\nambessa dead\n\njinx dead but hinted at being alive maybe\n\nwarwick dead\n\ndamn they really just left a huge question mark on like half the champs",
        "jinx and ekko arriving like some endgame portals cinema",
        "singed got the absolute best ending while committing all the war crimes\n\nturns out crime does pay",
        "ahahaha get fucked maddie",
        "not really seeing why everyones disappointed in jinxs fakeout death in her conversation with silco he tells her that killing is a cycle and the only way to get out is to literally run away she even admits to vi before escaping the prison that vi doesnt have to worry about her anymore \n\nby dying jinx gets to build a new story one not tied to her past crimes and trauma and vi as well as cait are aware of this",
        "the last two episodes needed to be like  hours each ngl",
        "very mixed thoughts on the finale i loved the talk between ekko and jinx i also liked zauns entrance into the fight \n\ni thought the way ambessa died was kinda underwhelming \n\nnot sure what happened to jayce and viktor its a bit unclear whether or not theyre dead \n\nim glad that jinx is at least implied to be alive",
        "okay but like lowkey im digging jinxs new shark hoodie look it looks amazing and ekko too",
        "well i guess that makes jinx a hero of piltover and zaun in perceived death",
        "oh people were right about maddie i didnt actually expect that theory to play out",
        "guys what do i do now",
        "what happened with future viktor was he the one who saved jayce as a kid he did this in multiple timelines why",
        "did a bunch of people jump to this episode without watching the other two",
        "loris no holy fuck",
        "holy sht ambessa was so cool in all her appearances i almost sided with her lmao",
        "so cait literaly giving optimus prime speech in the ending",
        "to the people saying ekko didnt really do much if he hadnt split victors mask everything would keep repeating as usual\n\ni know jayce played a big part as victors counterpart but ekko is really the boy saviour",
        "i feel like im losing my mind reading these comments jinx is clearly not dead thats like the whole point of the scene with caitlyn looking at the hexgate diagrams and then the balloon flying away and quick titlecard of the end with the jinx font there was the whole speech from silco about how she had to disappear to end the cycle its like very literally spelled out so clearly how are so many people misreading this",
        "so that leak was true wow",
        "aint no way maddie get outta here",
        "i swear if ecko and mel just had a conversation at any point in this series all this stuff could have been avoided lmao they carried",
        "am i the only one who liked the ending",
        "that was really beautiful and amazing in a lot of ways but to be honest im a little disappointed it felt like the show drifted heavily away from the main conflicts and ideas that made the show interesting initially zaun vs piltover progress versus caution trying to be cooperative and selfsacrificing to actors with slightly different interest versus defecting and willing to use violence or little things like is it okay to fund a destructive drug industry if it strengthens your marginalized and oppressed community economically what kind of response to terrorism and threats of violence is justified when a lot of it born as a response over policing and abuse of power how much should try to risk your safety and that of others to help someone misbehaving because of trauma and issues they need help with  etc all felt kind of pushed to the side  when jayce started talking about how victors broken leg and disease that was going to kill him actually made him better and it was wrong to try and fix that i just wasnt convinced at all about the point it was trying to make even granting everything that transpired in the story  idk im sure im missing a lot and it was very very cool and this is one of the most beautiful pieces of animation in a long time but so many of the ideas and events at the very end just felt sort of random and disconnected meaningfully to everything transpiring before",
        "are jayce and viktor dead they just like disappeared into the hexcore",
        "my reaction when jinx started falling with vander  hold on arcane",
        "so ummm \n\nwere all in agreement that jinx is definitely alive right",
        "i cant with this ending first i believe the lie that jinx is dead then i see all the people talking about why shes alive now im pissed at the ending not having her happy with her sister and boyfriend i can take viktor and jayce apparently dying or going through some crazy travel shit i can take heimer dying or maybe getting lost in the time stream i can take vanderwick not being restored and happy with his daughters i can even take singed getting a happy ending without repercussions but why must jinxpowder leaveeeee\n\nall i wanted was for the zaun kids to get some happiness in the end",
        "i just ahhhh ekko was given such a sad ending like unless he left with jinx which personally i think is not implied considering he burned a paper by himself on the ledge where he kissed au powder he is left with like nothing his mentor is dead his friends are scattered the community he founded is in shambles if half of them even survived he lost his time travel abilities which i think is okay because the fighting is over now maybe hes just left all alone and considering he saved the world he deserves better i hope we see more of him in the future shows and he gets a happier ending someday",
        "could we not have had  more episodes to make another act this all felt so rushed",
        "gotta say i do like that sky was symbolic for viktors humanity and her vanishing shows viktors complete descent to evil jesus",
        "i think it is really poetic and personally really like the ending even if it is heartbreaking\n\njinxpowders arc has come full circle season  was showing how powder became jinx with the final nail in the coffin being killing silco everything she touches everyone she loves gets destroyed she is already way too okay with dying seen when she uses the grenade on the bridge\n\nseason  isnt really healing to borrow from castlevania its the worlds longest suicidenote act  she simply doesnt care for her life any longer she wants to die but not by her own hands she wants her death to be dramatic thus she planned to unleash the colored gray as her final note\n\nim glad its you had to be you comes to mind\n\nact  she actually finds purpose again as ischas big sister she sees some good in the world again she rescues the girl the girl rescues her she has someone she cares for and is cared for in return being the symbol of the revolution freeing the zhaunites in stillwater reuniting her family by finding the bits of humanity left in vander and herself and showing them to vi there was hope for her again \n\nif ischa lived maybe there would have been a way forward that wouldnt have ended in tragedy however our little girl decided to do the herothing by using jinxs weapon and three hexgems to stop vander its a horrifying parallel to the end of sact retraumatizing her deeply her eyes even change from pink back to blue while screaming ischas name\n\npowder is back from the well so to speak and she simply cannot be any longer jinx because it all hurts too much even caitlyn can see it and jinxs sole priority being vis survival and not resisting arrest whatsoever makes it even more clear she cannot take it any longer she gives up\n\nin another interesting parallel vi actually asked for jinxs help but jinx doesnt want to help any longer but is locked in a room underground instead mirroring her leaving behind powder for the vander rescuemission in sact where powder wanted to help but vi didnt want her too\n\nthen we are shown her not caring to live season  to wanting to die season  act  to becoming actually suicidal silko tells her to end the cycle by walking away which she tries via monkeybomb then ekko stops his childhood friend who is his girlfriend in a paralell universe from blowing herself up multiple times mirroring the bridge scene in which he left her to die ekko sees powder again in the girl who he thought was only a monster im upset that we didnt see an extension of this scene where we see what he actually said to her so that she decides to help\n\nthey build a balloon ship from scraps fly up to piltover and join the fight and they are actually helping i think another scene is missing here in which the two of them rally the under city to join them with jinx being the symbol of zhaun being able to unite them\n\nthen shit hits the fan or more like the blimp hits the hexgate tower we get the sisters finally fighting truly side by side again jinx tries to talk vi away from warwick but it doesnt work in the end she saves vi with her bombs mirroring powders wish from the very beginning of the series \n\nher last act as powder is to try and save her family with her bomb ruining everything instead her last act as jinx is actually saving her sister with one of her bombs \n\n\n\nfull circle the beginnings of season  and the ending of season  mirror each other as shown above\n\nits kept a bit ambiguous if she is really dead with caitlyn having a part of the monkeybomb thus meaning they searched the tower for a corpse but still looking at microfilm of the towers schematics and its exits implying the case isnt closed vanderwick is however most likely dead since they drained him of his juice to supercharge victor something that would kill him as vicky said in sact\n\njinx however said it in the beginning of the season herself she has a hard time dying nowadays but she walked away nonetheless",
        "the following contains spoilers of the ending of arcane s\n\ni do not think the story of the characters is over but the story around the arcane is \n\nthat is why they were telling us arcane would only have  seasons \n\nit would not make sense to name the show arcane after that storyline is more or less finished \n\nregarding jinx i must say i was pissed first but she obviously survived it would not make any sense having caitlyn check the shafts on the computer and the show showing it to us if its not meant to hint to the fact jinx escaped there also the end scene is hinting to it\n\ni expect a series under a new name that involves jinx in the future\n\nalso a new show if not the same of jinx for jayce victor and mel\n\nthat are good news guys",
        "king ekko didnt deserve that sad ending man poor guy",
        "im just here sitting and feeling a little lost i felt like i watched a different show the ending could be a hint as there will be continuation for the characters as we travel to different cities or other champions focus but to get to this from s went really fast and scenes unearned",
        "they did heimerdinger so dirty",
        "i cant believe this was the ending was it good was it bad i feel weird",
        "this feel so rush   wtf is going on",
        "fish guy lived and maddie died thats basically all i need to be happy except for like all the champions that died",
        "i dont know what to think of the ending as a while but damn the final scene with viktor and jayce was stunning",
        "ekko needs respect for being the only person able to resist the transcendencezombification nobody else was able to do that",
        "damn my boy vander really went through it\n\non the brink of death from powders explosion  silcos stabbing  the fall   revived by shimmer\n\ndied from jumping out of a building to save vi  revived as warwick\n\ndied from ishas sacrifice  revived as evil warwick\n\ndied by jinxs sacrifice",
        "this act is going by so fast just me",
        "so i just finished and i feel stupid im sure im missing crucial game lore but i just feel like a lot went unanswered was it purposeful as if to leave it open for individual viewer interpretation or was it a rush job because they only planned two seasons and didnt have enough content for a season  i still loved it dont get me wrong i just had some qualms with the end arc maybe im missing something",
        "oh my god viktor and jayce are getting back together again jesus viktor spitting some facts and sending jayce on a journey to save him everythings coming full circle",
        "i dont even know what to say or think about this ending throughout the entire act i so thought ekko would do some back in time shit and fix everything before all hell broke loose nah all hell broke loose and thats the end of it and jinx what the hell mel was cool as hell to especially in that last episode always thought she was cool but dang they made her even cooler",
        "loris just dying like that caught me so off guard him dying broke me just like that dead",
        "sooo the next series is gonna be set in noxus then\n\nseeing swains demon raven d and the noxians sailing off",
        "my initial reaction to jinxs sacrifice was vi will never mentally recover from losing her family again from my perspective her demeanor implies vi knowssuspects jinx is alive andor caits cupcake cures decades of emotional trauma",
        "super conflicted about this im gonna get this out of the way arcane would have benefitted from another season or even another act they executed what they had well enough but i can tell that stuff had to be cut just to fit everything in \n\nthat said arcane as a whole had some of the most well executed and thoughtful writing that we rarely see ever even the rushed stuff was done well all things considered \nits am currently so i wont be doing a complete breakdown in this comment but the end with viktor and jayce was just so fucking good oh my god whoever was involved writing for viktor deserves so much praise \n\nthere is no prize for perfection only an end to pursuit \nthats some real shit right there animation is a legit medium and anyone that says differently needs to read that line and tell me that it isnt some of the most profound shit you ever heard seriously i didnt expect where jayce and viktors arc went and i am more than satisfied with their payoff god damn even if they dont continue arcane it would be such a shame if they just stopped writing league of legends lore like this even if i can only read it i dont care just give me more",
        "after watching it all i still dont get the storyline with the witches and the thorns with mel and their family and the sacrifice of the brother like",
        "im really angry that vi didnt have her moment in the last episode like why she is the first one who appears in the serie in the first season she had an amazing fight in the final episode but in a war she doesnt have a proper fight like wtf she barely appeared and she appears like a poor defenceless girl she always needs help come on a vs in  seconds would have been amazingdespite that amazing ending amazing season amazing music the beauty of the serie is unbelievable we will miss piltover so much",
        "telling myself jinx picked ekko up before leaving in the airship",
        "i need somebody to talk to about this with im actually going through it \n\njayce and viktor had me sobbing theyre my end game if u see it as platonic or romantic they are literally eachothers other halfs\n\nalso what the  im still processing this is to much",
        "regardless of whether she survived or not jinxs story felt unsatisfying to me vi mourned her sister for  seconds right after she died ekko looked sad about it and thats it thats the whole aftermath of jinxs life the person who managed to strike terror into the hearts of piltovers citizens and police who became the symbol of the resistance against the oppression two people sad for a second\n\ni believe they never shouldve included noxus black rose and mels story line the story we had was already packed as it was the most interesting part of the story was always the piltover and zaun conflict for me i think that was one of the main things that elevated the story of season one so much it already took a backseat during act  but it was almost nonexistent in act  all the nuance just vaporized\n\ni honestly think the end of episode  felt more conclusive and satisfying even if it was more depressing as a finale than this episode\n\noh well it happens the visuals music the artistry were still top notch i am deeply grateful for everyone who gave us this brilliant show against all odds and thank you guys in this sub for all the discussions and amazing art and hilarious memes you guys made the wait between episodes possible",
        "personally i was hoping wed get a better conclusion between vi and jinxin terms of actually talking that wasnt just them teaming up to fight together just a bit more of what we got during the village scenes \n\nalso maybe someone can point out if im wrong i get the point of having everyone think that jinx is dead to help them move past everything but imo having her have a last talk with vi to let her go properly instead of chasing her around would have been nice plus since cait seems to knowsuspect that jinx isnt dead wouldnt that also mean that vi would know as well",
        "honestly even if it might seem a bit rushed its impressive that they found a way to end everyones stories in arcane it was very clever that they did not show any actual death scenes heimerdinger jayce and victor they just disappeared jinxs sacrifice is believed to be fake which i agree with because for an animated show every pixel is planned so it would be meaningless to give us that many hints about her being alive if not\n\ni think this was a good way to end the show even if its a bit bittersweet because of the alternate ekkopowder storyline because in the future we might see our dead characters appearing in other regions \n\nalso do you think we will get an official answer about jinxs whereabout",
        "im so lost what do you mean you killed off four major characters at the last minute why was jayce alone at the hexgates what sense did it make for him to pull the cylinders out if viktor could literally walk in kill him and pop them back in \n\n  \noh em gee im so disappointed in season two  the ending is soo bogus and i saw a lot of people saying it wouldnt make sense if you didnt play the game especially mels background i thought i understood up until the part when mel was trapped in the rose prison thing but i dont understand why she trapped her mother just to step in two seconds later to save her and kill the black rose \n\nthen why the hell did vi not just jump i thought it was clear enough when jinx called vander twice that he couldnt be saved i guess the flashback to season one gave that context but its so crazy that they killed off jinx and in such a stupid way it seemed like she wanted to go out on her own terms which okay but this is insanity \n\nviktor and jayce just disappeared and dont get me wrong i love vi and caitlyn but why would they end the show with them alluding to a spinoff",
        "holy shit maddiecait supporters in shambles",
        "i was really expecting ekko to save everyone with his time machine thing or at least save jinx its a shame that loris was killed off without any main role also maddie sucks i practically cheered when she got killed",
        "so are jayce and viktor just gone now",
        "this feels like some crazy fanfiction when the fan cooked too hardddddd  lol",
        "you know i was watching the ending scene again and i realized caitlyn is looking at the hex gate buildings blueprints and it shows that the tall chamber that jinx fell down from has multiple air vents that lead outside whilst holding the monkey dolls head  \nand then at the very last scene it shows a blimp going off to the distance if you remember from aaall the way back in the first episode of season one where the crew came topside for the job a blimp flew right by them and what did powder say she said one day im gonna ride in one of those things  \nshes alive shes riding that blimp",
        "so what are they going to put in jinxs and warwicks bio dead",
        "the battle scenes in this episode are some of the best tv ive watched",
        "i feel like theyve made the arcane stuff way too complicated and with too little time to wrap it up causing other story lines to feel neglected or maybe viktor and jayce is the actual main pair of this story i really wish wed get to see jinx and vicaitlyn again",
        "i need to wrap my head around how to put my thoughts into words after watching the finale of what is by far my favorite cinematic production too many feelings are running through mei feel like i just need to sit and then go for a long workout to tire myself out after witnessing such a wellportrayed war between the characters its like experiencing a secondary trauma from watching that\n\n  \nevery line between jayce and viktor was pure epic yes evolution was great but as ms yang told viktor he wouldnt miss their conversations because what made viktor him was gone all that was left was the carrier of the arcane living in a void of emptiness calling out for hope from jayce across universes and timelines jayce understood what viktor was yearning forrescue from the isolation of striving for perfection\n\nwhat this conveyed to me is that perfection doesnt exist its the heartfelt bonds between people that move us forward and give us hope people you and me how we make each other feel is what keeps us human and different ekkos timerewind machine seemed to break into viktors mind giving him those few precious seconds to reflect on this truth\n\nfew things that made me confused was the fight scene when mel released black rose on her mother and the sister showed up and was like you are clever what the hell was that understandably now mel is no longer a fox she is now finally a wolf who understands the price to execute plus the release of the arcane fighters were a bit insane reminded me of i robot for a good  minutes\n\nokay back to the ending\n\nthe ending made me felt like caitlyn knows jinx faked her death to bring peace to vi and that jinx chose to leave so that she can break the cycle meanwhile vi believes her sister is truly gone as shown in her response to caitlyns question about whether shell keep fighting that dialogue reminded me of a scene in s when the commander asked caitlyn what are you shooting for for some reasons i feel like they didnt focus on vi as much this season compared to season  perhaps it was because vi simply never changed her intent has always been to protect her family with that being said we can predict vi more than any other characters because how well we know her intent and her reasonings since s\n\nthe mutual understanding between caitlyn and jinxto let vi believe she no longer needs to worry about giving up her sister or protecting her sisterwas such a powerful closure for her its a letitgo moment for vi as jinxs sister i can feel ike the writers were trying to give vi a new beginning a chance to live her own life by having cait addressed her name with violet not vi symbolizes her ability to now fight for herself and her beliefslove she can simply just exist being the dirt under someones nails she is just trying to find her peace and find herself a sense of being in a form of just being herself its the best gift she could have received thanks to the arcane production teams all casts voice casts animation team music team writers france tax rebate haha all of that thanks for ending the show with hope that everyone will find their closure it might not be now aka jinx but it will happen one day",
        "its a sad day for me because this show has now ended but goddamn what a fucking journey those last couple of scenes were just beautiful pitch perfect viktor and jayce finally reunited as brothers ekko being a badass and then looking extremely depressed at what could have been vi losing her sister again after finally getting her back and jinx omg jinx scarfing herself to save her family finding meaning after wanting to kill herself hopefully leaving the city in order to fulfill her potential i do believe she is alive who tf put in a scene of a characters looking at blueprints and seeing an escape route if it doesnt mean the character is alive",
        "ekko needs his own spinoff the dude is badass",
        "im the dirt under your nails cupcake im sick to my stomach i love them so much",
        "i wish we saw vi actually grieving her sister her sister was basically everything to her also eye patch cait is hot af",
        "was anyone left with a lot of questions or should i just feel stupid alone im always kinda slow when it comes to understanding stories and the last episode was particularly difficult for me lmao\n\nhowever i did enjoy it overall",
        "did not expect that out of the  red shirts to be introduced in episode  of this season that the fish guy with no lines and im not even sure what his name is would be the one to make it out alive",
        "i wish i had just stopped watching at act  i wish i could erase memories i just dont understand how they could build a literal masterpiece on the level of shakespeare and then make this was it riot interfering how did the writing style just completely change were they coerced into changing the script it literally feels like two different shows were created",
        "after a few days ive come to realize that ep  wouldve been the perfect penultimate episode  one more calm episode to properly wrap up how everything affected the state of zaun or the tree or somehow balance out caitlyns fascist phase or just give sevika one more line wouldve really helped imo",
        "sad \u00a0\nthis show will always hold a place in my memory\u00a0\ngoodbye arcane",
        "gifgiphyfbeiznqvbdwyxzxf\n\nehh about the ending",
        "jinxs sacrifice was everything wrong with season  imo it was small meaningless it happened after the battle was over and far away from the center of the action it came across to me as if the writers were going out of their way to make a statement that this story was never about two sisters while i can appreciate that on an intellectual level this was in fact a story about the arcane it still felt insulting that they drove the point home the way they did others have said it and i agree season  was about characters and relationships while season  was more about plot in the end for me season  was an almost perfect season of television because the whole was so much more than the sum of its parts while season  in the end doesnt work for me because the whole was so much less than the sum of its parts",
        "the leak is all true lol",
        "cant do this as a separate post but how the hell did ambessa die the fight black rose\nshes a tenacious warrior that fight was nothing and she was saved by mel from the black rose and wasnt fully corrupted so why is she dead\n\nplus some characters lived through wayyyy worse stuff seriously how is vi alive\n\nalso how does that tie in with the game because i think they decided to make arcane canon",
        "when warwick or victors vander warwick grabbed jinx around the waist i really thought they were just going to have his claws slash through her stomach oooweey im glad they didnt",
        "personally i did not enjoy act  i was hoping the jayce and viktor storyline was concluded since it felt like the b plot this entire time but then they made viktor the main boss and sidelined the jynx and vi story which is what made season one so good it felt weird and contrived all of a sudden",
        "dear god i need some time to process  \n  \nidk how i feel about riot probably canonically killing off multiple champions thats a bold move  \n  \nthe ending is sort of too open for my liking feels like theres more to come \n\nalso like wtf even happened to jayce and viktor exactly might need to rewatch\n\nwas still the best act out of the three though",

        "posted this on the act thread but i think it applies here as well spoilers for the end of the episode below incase you visit this thread mid episode\n\ni think writing wise and thematically act  was really well done could it have been better if they stretched it out a bit more yes but the quality of the writing this act was top notch\n\nas for the actual ending itself im left disappointed i think and there are a few reasons why\n\nthe smaller reason is jayce and viktor i think they actually wrap that up pretty nicely but there isnt really enough time after that for anyone to acknowledge or reflect on what jayce has done it is such a major moment and it feels like it winds up being a footnote\n\nthe larger reason is vijinx who in my opinion are the main characters\n\nthe first part is just the insane amount of misery in this show i like a bittersweet ending i like that not everyone rides off into the sunset but with this show i think it was out of proportion the amount of misery leading up to the end of this act deserved a bit more payoff to make it worth it and i think in the end we still have a ton of likable characters with subpar or upsetting endings\n\nand it is amplified by just how much they teased a good ending act  with vander episode  with the what couldve been timeline there was room to give us some of that and we got none of it\n\nthe second part comes back to vi and jonx and just how depressing their story is jinx gets a taste of family again with isha and vander but loses it all what is vis happy ending cait she still just lost her sister and clearly from her reaction after she comes back from viktors control she still has hope for vander family is so important to vi and it feels like it is consistently taken from her dangling a carrot in front of a horse\n\nvi gets absolutely shafted she cant save vander again and then cant save jinx i dont understand i wouldnt have minded them teasing vander if he was the catalyst that repaired the relationship with vijinx but the repaired relationship was so short lived it is difficult to really feel the impact of it similar to how quickly they move on from jayces ending\n\nand yes jinx may be alive still i know but if she is we still dont get to see any of the payoff of them fixing their relationship sure it may come up in a spinoff but i highly doubt they revisit these characters and while open endings are fine i dont think this show could afford them given just how negative the experience of so many characters was it leaves you feeling completely unsatisfied you get so invested in these characters and nearly no payoff to justify it\n\nit isnt that it was bad writing it is just so depressing and so unsatisfactory episode quality  amazing standalone value was really high in my opinion i dont blame anyone for liking it but i cant wrap my head around it at this point and it really just leaves a sour taste in my mouth considering how wonderful this show was i just wanted to like the ending after so much misery and given the lack of clarity with the ending i just cant ill have to sit on it more but i wanted to leave this show with a different feeling",
        "i have to say the ending is a bit bad for my sanity i mean deep in my heart i know jinx is alive however we will never find out how her character ends up due to this being the last season i mean did she find peace did she find a new place to call home will ekko ever find out\n\ni heard she and the other characters may have cameos in the future projects but im guessing it wont be like a long one explaining everything nor would it be really satisfying even the we have to wait for  years atleast to even have a chance at seeing these cameos im dying man",

        "jinxs death was so forced and her hiding away if she survives felt weird the whole jinxvi relationship made the show for most people and it just felt sidelined and a lot of plotlines got rushed or just felt unnecessary for example the black rose plotline was so unnecessary\n\nand why was ishas death scene so much better built out than jinxs death scene the flashback was underwhelming and didnt provoke emotions\n\nthe finale itself it just felt like shock factor for the sake of shock factor near the end\n\nembessas whole war felt rushed caits whole arc was rushed vijinx flip flop was rushed like i wish i could say it stuck the landing piltoverzaun are just homies now the common enemy trope introduced in  minutes solved decades of conflict but act  built something that act  could not deliver in  episodes\n\nepisode  was great i just wish the rest of the plotlines got the same treatment and were stretched out into maybe an act",

        "i have a feeling that jinx survived in the air ducts as at the end caitlyn is looking at the schematics of the hexgate\n\ni think that caitlyn knows that jinx survived however does not want to tell vi so that she can in a different way come to rest by always trying to save jinx its a shakespearean tragedy the one character believes the other dies but its for the benefit of both that vi does not know this and that she can now heal with cailyn by her side\n\ni think the circle of jayce saving victor is so fitting as well from the start of the show the hooded figure viktor saves jayce from dying in the blizzard and it all comes full circle with jayce saving viktor by opening his eyes to the calamity that he could have caused\n\nit is tough to wrap all the ends of characters that were involved and there were some stories within the show that did feel a bit rushed in ending or maybe a bit more time of explaining would have helped such as the black rose storyline\n\ni think the main characters from the beginning vi jinx jayce caitlyn and viktor all had their story archs completed in their own way\n\njinx  broke the cycle that she had with vi always searching and helping her finally being able to fly away on the ship and creating a new life\n\nvi  being with the person that she loved and hopefully healing from the tragedy of loosing her sister but at the same time subconsciously resting and not having to constantly worry about her little sister\n\ncaitlyn  was the person that was always wanting to help but was never able to find the right timing and finally at the end she is helping the person that she loved by helping vi heal from loosing her sister\n\njayce  completing the cycle that viktor had created and bringing their friendship back as the driving force after understanding what he needs to do when he realizes who saved him from dying when he was a child\n\nviktor  wanted to continue his work on the archane with jayce but jayce got caught up too much with the power and technology of hextech then at the end they were both in the arcane working together to save viktor just like viktor wanted when the two of them discovered it together\n\ntldr jinx survived through the vents the plots of all the main characters were all closed off in their own way to find peacejinx friendshipviktor and jayce and love caitlyn and vi",

        "jinxs death is really upsetting but it makes senze ever since she was a kid shes been trying to protect vi never caring for her own safety moreover she was already suicidal and thus less likely to look for a non self sacrifice method",
        "why for the f sake they had to kill jinx  \nall the evolved soldiers died with viktor yet warwick was somehow alive \n\nin all the possible ways jinx wouldshould have died which everyone would have let me really disappointed this was probably the most stupid and nonsense  \nand in the following scene vi seems to not give a fuck probably the already processed her death but still why did they do",
        "gonna be real the only characters i actually cared for were vi and jinx liked others though because of what was built up from season  i feel like outside of act  they really took a backseat this season mostly vi in the greater scope of things i think it was a satisfying finale but it felt like a different show almost really wouldve benefited from longer episodes couldve showed the convo between ekko and jinx when he stops her from deleting herself couldve showed those two rallying zaun to fight the noxians \n\nalso shoutout ambessa for looking like a fucking greek god felt like i was watching king leonidas march up those steps\n\nalso the writers are dicks man they had to know we really cared about vi and jinx being alive and together at the end so theyre alive but not together lmfao",
        "this isnt the same series",
        "i think the team had a huge job wrapping up all the storylines and they kind of dropped the ball trying to fit it all in the final episode it just didnt feel like a lot of the storylines paid off the way they should\n\nalthough i enjoyed all the action sequences the thing i love most about arcane was the character moments and it seemed like those moments were overshadowed by the plot moving so goddamn fast\n\njinx sacrificed herself but we didnt even get to feel that emotional gut punch before they hinted she had escaped victor and jayces ending was beautiful but still feels weirdly unsatisfying and rushed\n\ni really thought the whole episode was going to get reversed by ekko at one point but then it just ended\n\nand ending was just kind of bland\n\nso many incredible moments from the series with incredible music and then the ending of the series is really giving us nothing\n\nill probably give things some time to settle and rewatch but yeah the finale left a lot to be desired",
        "genuinely disappointed zaun and the sisters story took a backseat to noxus and the heralds plan",
        "season  was a masterpiece im sorry to say but the ending wasnt that great imo no explanation on why maddie changed allegiance to ambessa in fact she wasnt much of a character at all that goes with the rest of the squad from the first act the entire noxus plot was rushed with little care the first season was grounded and character driven and i loved it this season was all over the place with pacing issues and crazy magic \n\nalso sevika didnt speak once this actshe suddenly becomes a councillor and seems to have moved passed her grudge against piltover i get that shes acting as a representative of zaun but in prior episodes she couldnt grab the crowd or lead the people she was always the right hand i say this as shes my fav character her arc felt rushed as the other characters i still enjoyed this series immenselybut i aint lying when i say im somewhat disappointed \n\nthe caitvi sex scene was misplaced would have been better earlier in the season just felt weird after jinx threatened suicide and ran off nothing beats the first season imo",
        "while there were certain components i was happy with as to the finale this season definitely needed an additional act and i think this finale showcased it better than anything else this season it was a breakneck sprint to the finish and the lightspeed pacing of the season really hurt it season  of arcane was close to perfect for me but this season was closer to a  with act  being my least favorite of the three from the season",
        "arcane would have been so much better if the arcane didnt exist we lost so much time in these last few episodes trying to process what was going on with it and it lead to some of the least emotional deaths in the show\n\nsilco and the se deaths were all more emotional deaths than any of the deaths in this episode i think thats because we had to sit in the scene after they died instead of jumping to the next plot point instantly",
        "ok so after watching these last three episodes i bawled my eyes out especially when it came to viktor and jayces ending because like bro theres no way you can describe that as just partners even during season one and the beginning of season two jayce over and over again chose viktor over everythingeveryone else even at the very end he wasnt going to leave without him and even viktor was all wtf why i think it was an incredibly bittersweet ending for the both of them because while they knew they wouldnt be able to both out of it alive jayce chose to stay with viktor and viktor got out of his glorious evolution obsession because of jayces love for him whether it was love for him as his lab partner or something more you can decide for yourself but for me\npersonally i liked their relationship all the way to the end",
        "this is simply by far without argument the best ever animated tv series and by a long and far shot the best tv adaptation of a video game \n\nwhat an absolute masterpiece\n\nthank you to all the people who brought this to life youre amazing\n\nugh excuse me im gonna be in the bathtub blasting burn it all down",
        "i think one more episode for this season would have been good they couldnt give every character the screentime they needed some characters develop too fast or offscreen to get to the plot point the story demands for example sevika and the rest of zaun just join the fight on the side of pilltover but we dont see much of the moment where they come to the decision the conflict between topside and the undercity is a major part of the story and the resolution to it felt underwhelming the story would have benefited from more time\n\nstill this was a phenomenal season and its imperfection brings us back to the message of viktor",

        "still dont think we need a rd season still think we needed a th act we needed jinx vi and cait reconciling needed to see more of ekko and jinx so that they dont feel like a deus ex machina didnt need the black rose stuff because all that was is spin off bait",
        "after sitting on the maddie betrayal plot twist for a bit i kind of realised something \n\n\nin ep  we see caitlyn reject maddies comfort and when vi walks in and caitlyn asks maddie to leave and check on her father when she walks out she kind of looks jealous to me that vi is caits centre of attention instead of her so maybe that was when she contacted ambessa offscreen to plan to betray caitlyn and make her hurt as a form of revenge\n\n\nmy stubborn self refuses to believe that maddie was a sleeper agent all along because it just doesnt really add up esp in the first few eps where she was doing the direct opposite ie trying to lead caitlyn off the path of violence and following ambessa giving her the confidence to be a leader of piltover etc",
        "needed more ekko tbh",
        "can someone explain what happened to the romance between jayce and mel that was one of the issues that i finally caught into after episode \n\nthey went from being inseparable then to being completely platonic in act  he says a nice thing to her in episode  but theres no romance aura to their convo\n\ndid i miss something earlier i really liked their chemistry",

        "technically the world ending apocalypse is only caused by victor yes shimmer hextech etc were all evilsbut only victor evolves the way he does and tries to end humanity so if victor realizes that why cant he just kill himself in the timeline  show himself that instead of needed jayce to \n\nwe know for a fact that when victor says this is the only way it is not true  we have seen a utopian timeline in which it is not even about jayce he still got saved and created the crystals but the explosion killing vi stopped hextech",
        "that was the one of the best animated tv series but honestly im counting even real life not animated series i have ever watched and probably will ever watch in my life it was sooooo beautiful and i kept having to rewind to catch moments and dialogues and just bask in how beautifully it was all done",
        "i feel empty now its like i lost something valuable i want more of it i want to selfishly say that the last episode should have been a new season but it is what it is \n\ni wish the last episode had more room to breathe and stretch i was having so much fun that when the credits started rolling it made me sad i have finished it this is the end\n\narcane is such a masterpiece i love it so much i am excited about the other regions",
        "does anyone else think jinx is alive i mean if you really slow down the scene of her blowing up you can see a dash away from the explosion in the same color as when she does a fast dash with her shimmer abilities right before a full explosion then caitlyn looking at the blueprints to that building pointing out a way jinx could have escaped and again there was the shimmer dash in that explosion sooooo plus the last shot being the blimp powder said she was gonna be on one day and also if this is all true then it reflects on wilco saying the cycle only ends when you walk away so jinx faking her death and getting out on that blimp would be her walking away personally i think theres too much pointing to her still being alive to actually say shes dead",
        "personnally i liked the ending\n\nyeah the fight might have been rushed but then again all wars cant be as pretty as in the movies\n\ni also thought loris death showed up way early and barely impacted me but then i remembered that anyone can die in a battle within seconds so it makes sense he went out that way still sad",

        "can someone tell if im right viktor is the arcane and he was looking for a timeline that could stop him in order to break the endless loop right",
        "what was the flying boat at the end supposed to mean who was on there because when we see caitlyn at the end looking at the blueprints for the hex gates she zooms in on some vent or whatever it was does that mean that jinx is still alive and she was the one on the flying boat at the end trying to leave this part of her life behind maybe shes simply dead and im just coping but i was hoping for a more meaningful sacrifice",

        "holy cow maddie haters were right no way i defended her i wonder if she was allied with ambessa the entire time or if she turned at some point\n\n ekko in a crop top \n\n mel fighting was beautiful she proved shes willing to die for piltover\n\n glad to see sevika on the council finally she gets some respect\n i wonder what ekko told jinx to make her do a  that theres a different universe where she has everything she ever wanted idk sounds like that has a  change to make someone feel worse\n\n rip jinx i didnt think theyd kill her off not a fan of the redemption through death trope then again she already had multiple redemption scenes raising isha freeing people from stillwater almost saving vander fighting to protect people from noxus twice",

        "well i understand why general merdada disliked mages she had that fight fair and square until the sorcery\n\n\n\ni do like that caitlyn and the other heroes werent moving around by themselves and had teams with them i like that ekko showed up with the firelights too\n\n\nspeaking of was maddies betrayal a crime of opportunity or was it planned all along im guessing the former\n\n\nthe decoy was a smart move\n\n\n\noverall i do like the ending i do like that jayce and victor managed to talk it out it wouldve made sense for jayce to have shown victor his experience in the ruined future at the commune but perhaps this was fated to happen or something\n\n\ni like that fishcop survived although im sad that loris did not hopefully this leads to better relations between piltover and zaun im surprised to see a unified council although zaun probably needs more representatives im really surprised sevika surived haha although im not unhappy she did\n\n\n\ni like that the episode showed the cost of war\n\n\nhope mel and jayce will maintain good relations in the future oh wait he disappeared well when he presumably returns then\n\n\n\ni feel bad for vander\n\n\nekko my boy\n\n\n\ni do wonder how piltover will be viewed internationally now im assuming its gonna lose a lot of prestige and prosperity likewise with house kiramman will be interested to see how they rebuild\n\n\n\nnow i do like the ending and this season as a whole but it does still feel a bit uneven to me and i need time to let my thoughts settle i do hope that future shows in this universe will keep building on what we have even sideways \n\n\nfor example i suppose mel being able to overpower the black rose magician was because the arcane awakened and maybe something to do with her magic specialty but its a common trope for a neophyte to beat an experienced expert which is a trope i rarely like not finding it very rewarding or wellexecuted most of the time\n\n\nmaybe just me but i find the cosmic tones of this season slightly less compelling than the streetlevel more intimate stuff we got last season i mean i get that family and bonds are still very important this season but idk i like the grounded feel of season one a bit more and it just felt a bit more tightlycrafted will definitely need to rewatch a few times and reflect a bit",
        "i didnt like it it bothers me that some characters are the same as in lol while others are completely different sorry but these are not viktor and definitely not warwick i dont know how people arent talking about this i really regret how rushed the ending felt and i think there were many things that only made sense to those familiar with the games lore especially in the last episode",
        "all things considered it still is a pretty great show imo one of the best animated western shows of all time but this ending was a little lackluster i really did not vibe with the social issues of zaun and piltover being shoved to the side for a generic enemies team up for a final battle against a big army finale and then never really being revisited besides the shot of sevika at the table and i was not a fan of the black rose stuff either its a shame cause as usual the visuals were phenomenal and the dialogue was incredibly tightly written from start to finish in particular jayce and viktors conversations i really just wish they had gone a different direction narratively for the final act ideally a bit more political and a little less magical\n\nalso heimerdinger was written out of the story in an incredible weird way what happened to him and why did it happen like that",
        "torn up about it it felt like two too different storylines not really meshing up pilltover and zaun and glorious revolution\n\nto solve social issues by having everyone team up against a third threat is really worn out imo\n\nalso jayce viktor heimerdinger and vander are all dead what\n\njayce and viktor viktor said only this timeline works but we saw one without hextech were everyhting was seemingly fine soviktor did all that because otherwise jayce would die as a child",
        "so wtf exactly happened between melambessasorc didnt make any sense mel pulled her mom into the blackrose shit to then get her out  seconds later and boom shes dead",

        "that ending wasweird like really really weird like why was warvanderwick still alive at the end when all the other viktor puppets had been shut down dude was clearly fully assimilated by that point feels like it was done just to have your stereotypical dramatic ledge hang moment and it feels like vi didnt really heavily react to losing her sister massive quotation marks because you know i like what she and cait got going but after everything she went through she seemed weirdly welladjusted and stable after seemingly losing the laat family member she had left and she was just starting to reconnect with an act prior\n\nalso i love my man ekko hes the goat but its a bit weird that he and jayce didnt talk once after coming back from their time travel adventures he clearly had enough time to set the firelighters and jinx up why not check in with the other dude who got zapped away and managed to somehow get back if nothing else just to tell that heimer got blasted into dust and before anyone comments that he didnt know jayce was back with how important jayce is in piltover and how he was a big part of organizing the defense efforts he sure as shit wouldve known or at least be able to inquire about his presence logically it wouldve been one of the top  first things hed do\n\nalso mel just had her partnerboyfriendfuckbuddypolycule member be sucked into the shadow realm together with his partnerboyfriendfuckbuddyfellow polycule member and we dont really see her react to it not even a cowabummer or anything like at all shes just in charge of the medardas now would love to see how shed react to this position or whats going through her head oh well\n\nthere are a dozen other things i could list off but overall it was all justweird",
        "deleted",
        "im still confused about the whole reveal that viktor is the guy who saved jayce as a child and also kept giving him different runes what was his goal is it a time loop i dont get it",
        "so many epic moments my favourite is prolly ekko spamming his ult \n\ni loved the ending and im really gonna miss this show i cant wait to watch their future projects gg",
        "if someone asked me how rushed this episode was id show them that scene where ambessa was about to give a big villain monologue to mel but cait suckerpunches her and tells her to shut up and fight even ambessa was caught by surprise",
        "why was vander the only glorious evolution thrall still active after we clearly see all the other ones shut down makes the whole sequence leading up to jinxs sacrifice feel forced",
        "just finished tonite watched the finale with my kids im shook i cant put into words how affected i m was by this entire series blown away so many incredible scenes fraught with meaning one that affected me so hard was when singed and victor went into warwickvander and extracted gave to singeds daughter destroyed it vanders soul",
        "wait and now he cannot rewind jinx from falling of a ledge cinema",
        "life is strange ah scene",
        "might be one of my favorite scenes in the whole show hurts so good",
        "also fitting because jinx told vi there were no versions of her that were happy and ekko saved her because he met that happy version of her",
        "she has literally biggest victory after singe finally she gets what she wanted sitting behind the table no longer following flawed leader and becoming what she always wanted excellent",
        "sevika is probably dead inside and ready to punch the grim ripper in the face",
        "sevika stays winning thats my goat",
        "i always had the feeling that eventually she will take her place as a leader instead of just being the next in line for others",
        "classic mid lane coming in for the late game clutch when supports are nowhere to be seen even and adc and jungler are just goofing off smh",
        "and ekko got the worst one",
        "honestly he doesnt deserve that shit lol they probably should have just shown him being taken away by noxians or something and left oriana alone",
        "deserved dude was willing to do whatever was necessary to get his child back and the universe said you know what ill allow it",
        "those zaunites cause nothing but trouble i tell ya one of thems messing with time and the other is annihilating humanity",
        "if im getting it right he was the mage that saved jaycee at the start too basically a paradox and hes been trying to find a timeline that will break to loop",
        "reminds me of eren jaeger and grisha in aot",
        "it was me barrie i fucked up the delicate balance of your twocity state",
        "confused about what jayce and viktor actually did to help end the hex core when their consciousnesses were talking in the rainbow swirly place when then they finish it together isnt what blew up all the arcane corrupted stuff ekko throwing his z drive at viktor what does jayce touching his stone to viktor and sacrificing himself actually do someone explain to me pls",
        "i dont think cait is gonna die but mels entrance by killing maddie is such a badass scene bubbled that bitch and let the bullet ricochet to a headshot thats gangster bro",
        "i was actually mad sweating still traumatised from lexa and villanelle",
        "i was waiting for the last second save but then i saw the gunshot go off and i gasped because they were killing a main character then i saw the spell and felt so much relief it literally couldnt have been a more last second save",
        "i am usually pretty good at predicting these things but i did not see her betraying cait coming",
        "im still gonna kill you now but i gotta say you give good head girl",
        "bro came outta nowhere in s and did a whole lotta nothing cant help but respect it",
        "i had to do a double take when he died especially with how he was introduced i remember reading so many threads speculating on his true identity and how he knew more than he was letting on but nope he was just a kinda chill dude brought down by the weakest weapon on the battlefield",
        "honestly this one hit me in the gut the most",
        "his death was really grim for me though i expected him to at least be shown fighting side by side with vi using his shield thrown off his cannon and forced to fight in melee but nope lights out after immediately being targeted by the noxian troops",
        "hey dont forget fish guy he made it did he even have a name",
        "i would love for linke to actually explain the point behind loris\n\n like why who from where",
        "it was so jarring hearing him speak so much",
        "was his name even said once i swear it was only in the credits  \nwhy couldnt they just stretch the season a bit more or do one more so many characters and story beats couldve been fleshed out more",
        "seriously i loved how she outsmarted everyone with making them think that victor is inside the ball lmao not to mention having madide as spy",
        "v and she still bodied",
        "average noxus warlord",
        "what an absolute unit i knew she was a fierce warrior but damn i dont think anyone could have beaten her without cheap tricks if they even did work",
        "thats exactly what i thought lol i think that was the intention but im not sure",
        "yes i agree with you like im  sure the writers wanted to show the scene where caitlyn was looking at the hextech air vents was to indicate their mission was to locate jinx and the writers did said that they were going to explore more of the lol lore so i think we will get jinxs appearance alongside with new characters from other places i really feel that for the show to pull in the arcane only viewers for the next seasons they need to have cameos of old characters",
        "she made it out for sure theres a pink line right before the explosion cait checking the vent records flying away in an airship was a dream of hers since episode  the jinx text at the end there",
        "there also was shimmer line going away from the explosion on highspeed",
        "not to mention the suspiciously long single streak of pink during the explosion darting away she  lived",
        "love how he popped by the academy to pick up the hexclaw",
        "just dropping in to say smile  was genuinely one of the best movies ive seen ever so well done",
        "i though they would need to basically rework viktor to match his arcane self but his final look was amazing and not that hard to see implemented in league",
        "maybe crime really does pay off",
        "he who does the most warcrimes wins or smth like that",
        "im not trying to justify the man but he did suffer for seemingly decades and at this point i kind of dont blame him for saying fuck everyone im getting mine he did bring that suffering upon himself though trying to play god",
        "me after act  nah shes good she kept cait levelheaded and stayed with her when she needed time \n\nact  what the actual fuck the haters were all right luckily she died in a super funny way super fast well done mell",
        "bruh the leaks were all right fuck man",
        "ngl i kinda hated this  it felt like a fanfic cliche",
        "literally why lol",
        "spoiler caits last scene while she sees all those papers from mom",
        "vander saved her he freed her from warwicks grasp or even threw her to safety the flashback is from vander not powder or vi",
        "cant say for sure jinx is driving that airship but yeah its heavily implied",
        "this episode is the most emtional for me somehow ekko saying goodbye to alter powder hit me more than jinx saving vi",
        "it was the only one that gave its characters any time to breathe",
        "i think because its kind of removed from the grander plot its a more slow characterstory focused on few characters which is what arcane is best at episode  was the only episode that felt like season  to me",
        "can you explain the significance of this im still confused how it stopped the anomaly\u00a0\n\nalso is victor the mage jayce saw as a kid",
        "meanwhile mel and caitlyn treat him like a fucking strangerwhat was the point of them being his girlfriend and childhood friend again",
        "i personally never shipped them but their bond was absolutely beautiful reminded me a lot of aragorn and boromir \n\ni wouldve followed you to the end my brother my captain my king \n\nthe way aragorn comfortedhonoured boromir is so sweet tenderness in male friendships is sadly such a rare thing to see \n\nalright im gonna go cry again now",
        "our only hope now is for a sevika spinoff",
        "yeah its so brutal and well done",
        "to be fair viktor had good intentions and tried to make a peaceful painless and warless reality for humanity possible i wouldnt say that he is bad or evil just someone who went too far in trying to be good \n\nhe wanted to destroy the hexcore after it killed sky and turned destructive but later found out that he could seemingly heal people with his new abilities and helping people is exactly what he wanted from the start when jayce almost killed him he proved to viktor that human emotions are at fault for all the chaos wars and suffering and made him go on his path to cure all of humanity\n\nhowever the arcane is much more powerful and destructive than viktor expected and he only realised that when he won and was the only one left which is why he went back in time to save jayce and warning him about the future because he regrets what had happened\n\nwhat his character needed was to explore his motivation further instead of speed running his development to get to the arcane version of his league counterpart as quickly as possible and trying to make him look like the main villain and final boss of the series when his motivation was just a misguided attempt to do something good which didnt sit right with me at all\n\ni do get that the arcane messed with his mind and influenced him along with jayce proving him right that emotions result in chaos and having died or came very close to dying several times but the execution was rushed and messy\n\nim glad that they redeemed him again in the end though and somewhat gave him a happy ending where he could be with jayce despite what happened between them",
        "crazy that they still killed off some league champs though\n\nto be fair did they jinx likely made it out singed is fine so he could create another warwick jayce viktor and even heimer all just disappeared rather than explicitly die\n\nhonestly seems like a good way to get some real impact with characters actually being gone while also leaving it open enough that in the league universe they still exist",
        "gifgiphyorfmkofxpvk",
        "the real mvp was that one soldier who took his place after he died way to go random soldier no",
        "oops",
        "shes gonna go see whats west of westeros",
        "lmao yes because why else would they show the air balloon that powder said shed one day be on and end it in a jinx the end it has to be riot cant kill her",
        "deleted",
        "my thoughts exactly people are dogging on ep  for not giving enough time to flesh out the other parts of act  but i think its an issue of concept rather than execution none of these story beats felt like the direction the show needed to go whether or not we had more time or not",
        "i hate to agree because i love the show but yeah i think they jumped the shark a bit the first season felt so grounded and very personal compared to this the first act of season  felt like a very natural continuation of season  but after that it kinda went off the rails",
        "did they die frr like if mage viktor needed to jayce to see that jesus viktor was wrong then all that did happen then so would it be possible that they went somewhere else and viktor aged to become the mage viktor\n\nif not where did the mage viktor come from",
        "i feel like its so weird to think they die im on the fence that they are dead they could magically come back since all that happens to them is they get whisked away by the rune after saving everyone i think they maybe alive just their story in the world is over",
        "that transition was fantastic for sure",
        "jayce and viktor what are we some kind of arcane now \n\nheimerdinger i feel like was more definitively meant to be dead sacrificing himself for the potential he saw in ekko \n\njinx has got to be alive with the ending hints and how much development has gone into her also shes kind of the face of the show popularity wise i may or may not be huffing copium right now jinx cant be dead",
        "probably a set up for potential future series around a different region champions where the arcane storyline might be referenced and some of these questions answered i personally think ww jinx and heimer i think yordles are immortal are alive and viktor and jayce are gonna be affected by the hextech and play some role in the future storyline regarding mages",
        "i think jayce viktor heimer and jinx are all tucked away nicely as characters that could come back in some form or another",
        "if they ever want to bring them back\n\ni could see something like viktor andor jayce being lost in a timeywimey arcanewhatever dimension and them stumbling upon a drifting banjoharmonicaplaying heimer ready to help\n\nwould it be satisfying to see this idk probably not just something they could do",
        "jayce  and viktor  unknownarcane bullshit \n\nheimer not dead no shadow when he disappears compared to goat man in earlier ep \n\nambessa   only major character who actually died\n\nwarwick alive his wounds regenerate from what we got told before but wander is gone for good thanks to viktor \n\nekko alive and well \n\njinx  alive sails away unsure where\n\ncait and vi alive a couple will set out to find jinx \n\nmel now ruler of noxus",
        "right normally i see then the reinforcements arrive coming a mile off but i was so invested in the battle that it actually caught me off guard here it was so hype especially with their insane style of fighting",
        "i mean i guess they were the two that were going to change things in the parallel hell jayce dies fighting with that hammer but echo came back with that impossible device that victor didnt see coming and prevented jinxs death you could argue that victor sent jayce back to stop himself but he still failed without echos intervention",
        "just look at whos president",
        "people were theorizing if she was a traitor or if was gonna die\n\nyes\n\nmaddie\n\nget rekt",
        "my problem is its vis mindless behavior cause of that again like what did she expect to do on a ledge that is literally falling",
        "i wanted to know who the deceiver was",
        "i loved the way ambessa died actually being brought down by the products of her ambition with mel weaponizing her birthright and caitlyn making use of the principle of sacrifice",
        "i feel the same ab ambessas death haha",
        "the hair looking like a long ass goofy tongue was funny af but still looked dope",
        "a big fat hero",
        "watch episode  on repeat again and again and again",
        "until jayce could save them in one of the timelines though it looks like the timeline without hextech was the best one so idk",
        "he explained it by saying basically after he made the world perfect there was no need for pursuit turns out turning everyone into one hive mind with no wishes or wants or motivations in life makes a terrible future one that is literally empty\n\nand viktor prob was chillin there for millenia like ooops",
        "huge chunk of comments were posted like in the vicinity of hour or so when act  was released they skipped to the end and came here to complain exact thing happened to fallout subreddit lol",
        "like wtf am i reading the last  episodes were cohesive and made sense were people scrolling tiktok the entire time or something",
        "removed",
        "wish she used her signature weapon more",
        "whaaaaat iiiive dooooooooone",
        "ekko was the mvp for sure",
        "seriously ekko stopped viktor from turning everyone into some inhuman one",
        "you know what pisses me off jayce couldve just gone to viktor before shooting him through the chest and said hey buddy i traveled through time and you sent me hear yourself say the reason why",
        "oh i literally just said this lol its frustrating bro these people dont understand very basic storytelling also powder literally said she would escape zaun on a blimp one day in the first season i just wish ekko went with her since it seems his arc with the fireflies is mostly wrapped up",
        "fuckkkkkkk",
        "if u shuffle the name maddie you can form the phrase im dead which is probably what she was thinking while being dead",
        "viktor  jayce ending was great vi now can focus on herself caitlyn got her girl  zaun is now not a danger anymore actually someone from zaun is in the council no more hextech jinx got his airship drive what she dreamed ofhopefully with ekko\n\ni dont think mel needed an ending because she will be in the noxus season if we get one\n\n  \noverall i liked the ending",
        "i liked it quite a bit  the beginning of the last episode was brutal though",
        "might be because i dont care about lol lore but i really liked the ending",
        "i thought it was great i think my only problem is with how jinx died i am not opposed to her dying in general and actually think that she had to die for the show to be satisfying but i wish it wasnt vis mistake that made prompted her sacrifice just because vi is haunted enough",
        "judging by the ratings definetly not lol do not be afraid to like whats great everyone can have his opinion but this is one of the best ending ever",
        "also jinxes end feels kind of underwhelming and unearned like most of her arc in the story wasnt about not being self sacrificing enough but being hurt and betrayed by others during extremally vulnerable moments to the point of having a hard time trusting others or not acting in ways that exacerbate problems even just for herself instead of helping having her self sacrifice at the end didnt feel related to any of that or her mental illness or how she sees herself or if she ids as jinx vs powder etc",
        "glad someone else felt the same way about jayces weird speech about imperfections its a fairly common theme but most of the time including here it doesnt get executed very well usually i think what the writers are trying to say is that we should accept our imperfections in the moment and in the past as part of ourselves instead of feeling guilt or shame the issue is when the writers try to apply the idea of imperfections  good too broadly not recognizing that people are capable of accepting their imperfections while still trying to work on fixing them \n\nthe examples given were especially cringeworthy is jayce really implying that viktor would be less admirable if he was able to find a cure to his physical ailments as someone with a neurological disorder these lines really fell flat to me the issue was never about viktor creating a perfect world the issue was that viktor created a mutant cancer magic wasteland \n\ni think it would have made a lot more sense and even fit in better to the main themes of the show if jayce instead gave some speech about individuality vs conformity or something along those lines the part where he was advocating for choice and free will were good i dont know why they decided for it to become a perfection vs imperfection argument in the end",
        "theyve become one with the hexcore",
        "imagine going back in time to help your friend to stop yourself in the future and he time travels to the end of the future then time travels back to the present causing both of you to get deleted out of existence\n\nfucked up life",
        "the writers didnt tell you anything more than you needed to hear it and they didnt include anything that didnt need to be included i see no other reason the caitlyn computer scene would be in",
        "but why must jinxpowder leaveeeee\n\nshe had to leave to heal so others can heal from the pain she caused and to break the cycle of killing she also had to leave so riot could use her in other animated properties",
        "jinx leaving faking her death or not is probably one of the good things in the ending if jinx stayed she would unintentionally force vi to choose between sister and cait because there still would be some hate between these two even if they would try to pretend otherwise",
        "i like that the writers made him saving the world because in the first episode of season  ekko was the one who gave the tip so vi and the others could rob jayces place\n\nthats such a cool detail and i know there are a bunch of them i missed",
        "honestly i dont even need an entire act just give me like an hour to each episodes and i would be good lol",
        "the pacing is my only gripe with this season vi jinx and caitlins motivations seemed to constantly turn on a dime",
        "with the cost of production i dont think more episodes were an option",
        "the whole war should have been an act imo",
        "sky saying that viktor wont miss their talks savage",
        "we going to noxus next with mel idk where what we think jinx is going there at the end with the air baloon tho",
        "yeah i feel like the show evolved a little two quickly into fullscale war from magical cops and robbers i think noxus shouldnt have had such a key role in the end i also didnt really like viktors overall direction in the end i cant really put it into words but i kinda wanted him to be more simple and just lost his mind to hextech not some nearomnipotent avatar of mind control plus his development into that was kinda lost on me he went from wanting to help people after his revival into some cliched nihilistic villain who hates human emotion without any particular real development between the two points i mean he got shot but he didnt seem particularly altered by the experience",
        "he sacrificed his limitless life for the potential of the future and the boy who made him trully feel alive in his maybe thousand of years",
        "i feel like it was a bit rushed definitely should have been a few more episodes",
        "ngl i thought this episode was the worst in the series and i dont usually grade too hard the show was best when it was going back and forth between zaun and piltover with their politics and way of life \n\nthe bigger it got the more it lost its touch a story of  sisters to an all out war from space jesus meh",
        "the whole season was like that tbh",
        "too many storylines man even vi was just a bystander",
        "the whole season  feels rushed man people might not agree but thats just the way it feels and they hamfisted an unnecessary time paradox at the end of the show",
        "dude league lore had nothing to do with it idk tf they did with jayce and viktor storyline they made way more complicated than they needed it to be and than like drag everyone along with it",
        "ngl its so fucked up his life was kinda predetermined to that exact moment and getting deleted out of existence to save the world and viktor lol",
        "vi might have found peace with it all she probably knows shes alive from caitlyn her last conversation with jinx in the prison cell involved jinx lamenting vis attempts at chasing her and trying to redeem her from that vi might now think jinx doesnt believe she can be redeemed but she might be able to start over where people dont know about her past wrongdoings thus the best thing for jinx if is vi lets her go if vi has that view of her she can be at peace with no longer having a relationship with her sister",
        "mel is a sorcerer and the black rosesecret organization in noxus wanted to use her to get to her mother black rose initially thought the dangerous child was kino mels brother so they killed him this enraged ambessa hence she wanted to take revenge against the black rose but she is powerless against this group so she wanted to use the hextech to defeat them meanwhile mel gains her sorcerer powers and tries to reason with ambessa which fails in that final confrontation so she uses that necklace given by the black rose sorcerer which traps ambessa mel figuring all this out comes back in and saves her mother from the sorcerers but its too late\n\ni bet the next series will be focusing on the noxians which is a different region in runeterra with mel being one of the characters bridging arcane show and whatever the new noxian show will be called",
        "its my favorite animated series ever but i geniunely disliked act  basically went into the bag of things i despise lol time travel different universesalternate timelines paradoxes nonsensical war decisions and choreography sigh\n\nvi and jinx were insanely wasted in the last arc and the show also completely abandoned show dont tell in the last episodes",
        "the folded paper ekko was burning at the end was for heimer for his sacrifice jinx was just giving ekko some space for mourning before they leavei am not being dragged to the nearest asylum",
        "the whole noxus or jayce minions felt like the typical third faction classic just so the first and second factions will join and fight together instead of each other its like batman vs superman or godzilla vs kong band together to destroy common enemy piltover and zaun conflict resolved \n\ni dont know the game lore from my understanding of season  piltover has jurisdiction over zaun but they were shit about it the zaunites were suffering and wanted changes by the end of the series sevika is part of the council so the people of zaun finally have a representative \n\nthe way i see it caitlyn will continue being an enforcer but she will be a fair one commanding the enforcers in piltover and zaun not bribed compromised etc",
        "good",
        "same with heimer so is he just in another timeline now and what happened to the heimerdinger of that timeline",
        "bro i swear all the crazy theories came true lol",
        "theres also a flash of her art at the end and if you watch the explosion closely theres a pink shimmer trail above it",
        "thank you so much i feel really dumb i was like why are they showing that airship  and after that i only thought of all the other many things in this episode i didnt understnad and immediatly forgot the last shot\n\nit was a bit too much this episode that i even missed the less compex things\n\nim happy shes alive though",
        "schrdingers cat",
        "i know they did the sisters relationship wrong the whole season its their biggest mistake imo",
        "i think they were implying she isnt dead",
        "preach brother only hope is people will understand it when the honeymoon phase passes",
        "the scene with him in the sky or whatever made my jaw drop the most beautiful thing ive ever seen",
        "there was no vander inside him anymore at all just the parts to the two headed wolf so it was only warwick who cant die or can selfheal quickly there was no part of viktors control left of course either its just my theory tho and i think warwick is dead for real now tho",
        "whole storyline shouldve been removed and saved for its own show",
        "and they were anomalymates",
        "lol so much for the leaks are fake yall dw dw",
        "shes not dead at the beginning i thought all the theories about jinx not being dead was hard puffing on copium but when you watch the end again with that context it makes so much more sense why was there one singular pink thunderbolt just like jinx eyes always light up when she goes meamode that went towards a vent why does caitlyn smile when looking at schematics of random vents in the tower why is there a random airship at the end jinx said something about i will fly one of those things when im older in seaosn  also jinx saying well always be together even when were worlds apart\n\nits very obvious that shes not dead with all those clues just need to know that context and you will see it too probably",
        "i think it illustrates the depth of a connection by the soul despite the definition of the actual relationship if cait and vi foil them theyre passionate and emotion driven live in the moment and are adaptable while jayce and vik are calculated and focused and live to build the future",
        "adding mins per episode this season could do wonders",
        "gifgiphylpubfzpvxfzgl\n\nno explanation needed",
        "so im not  sure either mel had a brother when they were younger and the black rose is a kind of magic wielding cult or smth which seems to be in war with noxus for a long time the black rose is prob on of the reasons for ambessa to come to piltover in s in the first place to seek out new weapons cause apparently their kind of loosing \n\nso the black rose follows to piltover and captures mel trying to convince her that her mother heartlessly sacrificed mels brother in an act of war implying that ambessa did so after he found out some secret about her trying to turn mel into a silver bullet against her mother mel is interested in learning the fate of her brother but mistrusted the black rose from the beginning accusing them for hiding its true nature when mels power awakened which seems to be triggered by life threatening danger like rockets and stuff and is also tied to the awakening of the arcane the black rose stated that they are not the same that she is a rare expression of what seems to be the head title of magic users \n\nmel stays suspicious of what the black rose stated but agreed to the gift of her welcoming present which is this necklace the black rose give her mel then returns and confronted her mother about the black rose and what really happened to her brother ambessa told her that the black rose is telling lies to deceive their opponents that her brother gut curious about the black rose got inbetween the fronts and she was forced to sacrifice him to protect mel she also stated that shes hurt by that sacrifice by an emotional wound which will never heal mel accepts that and then offer to oppose the black rose with her if she leaves piltover now ambessa denies that as with viktor she had found another way to defeat the black rose\n\nin their final confrontation on the battlefield the rose captures ambessa when she was vulnerable after caitlyn disabled her shield against magic it seems like the necklace mel was wearing did enabled the black rose to do so but as the black rose is confronting the incaptured ambessa mel interfered told them she had can see through their lies and purged the black rose off from ambessa who dies of her wounds soon after making mel the new leader of noxus\n\nwhatever the truth is mel in the end decided to believe that her mother was forced to sacrifice her brother to safe her also the reason mel was sent away to piltover right after her brother died but also she opposes her mother goal in capturing piltover and essentially enslaving all of their habitants to viktors arcane hive mind so she maybe consciously used the black rose to disable her mother when she was vulnerable but then purged the roses hold of her mother to end things on her own terms not on the black roses terms proofing that she indeed is the wolf",
        "does that mean that jinx is still alive and she was the one on the flying boat at the end trying to leave this part of her life behind\n\nyes she is alive and will definitely be part of other league of legends animated properties certain shippers should get excited",
        "mel used her mom as bait to draw out the black rose leader as well as used the black rose leader to take out her mom she played both of them against one another mel decided neither of them had the right path for her and she ended them both rather brilliantly",
        "i was expecting ekko to appear and do his thing and then its already been  seconds fuck she may still be alive tho",
        "going to an alternate dimension where the blue haired secondary protagonist has a vastly different personality to the normal timeline \n\nmade by the french\n\nlife is strange ahh act if i may say",
        "bro was going back to the quicksave to pick the right dialogue options",
        "ah so this is what people meant when they said arcane was based off a videogame",
        "powder will remember that",
        "it was a very minor scene but despite so much wrong things happening due to singe i am kind of weirdly happy for him that he somehow managed to bring his daughter back",
        "idk why but singed not taking ls after this whole conflict pisses me off",
        "finally she gets what she wanted sitting behind the table no longer following flawed leader\n\nthe true moral of arcane is that if you want to make the world a better place you need to be childless no distractions",
        "deleted",
        "support mell is too busy carrying cailyns ass keeping her on life support",
        "ekko got to keep his world and life maybe nobody will know what he did to save them but at least he did it",
        "ekkos jinx is out there somewhere on her airship theyll figure it out",
        "he is heading to noxus dont worry",
        "everyone needs a hobby",
        "dont forget the domestic terrorist and the drug lords",
        "theyre dangerous  \nim from the undercity\n\nhe did tell us i suppose",
        "god forbid zaunites do anything",
        "yes basically",
        "not only did she kill maddie in an epic way but she also protected her mom from one of the ricochet paths of the bullet lol",
        "i mean he was there for vi when she hit rock bottom thats gotta count for something",
        "he eavesdroppingthenpretending to be asleep when maddie was telling vi about how much cait defended her never led to anything did it i thought he had hidden intentions or planned to talk to vi about it\n\nkinda random",
        "it was the way it was done  just quick cold blooded murder not everyone gets a heroes death even if they deserve it godspeed lorris\n\nmy man steb is alive and well though",
        "i feel so cruel but i was gonna laugh if the other solider guy just threw him off the building",
        "steb",
        "he was there to look like vander and then die",
        "pretty sure all he was there for was that one scene where he reminds vi of vander",
        "vi says it after she wakes up and thats about it this fucking ending man",
        "the maddie twist actually got me so bad \n\nthis whole time i thought she was just a sweet side character with a delightful accent  but nope",
        "the caitvi shippers including me found the ultimate reason to hate her",
        "turns out ambessa never needed to recruit vi since she had maddie as a plant the whole time",
        "average bot lane vs top lane league fight",
        "top laner was in melee range vs adc and support",
        "dude the fact she survived a warwick attack says a lot about her prowess love being able to see her in action finally",
        "just gonna leave these here",
        "that would make sense with the og lore of cait and vi chasing after jinx endlessly i can see them going jinx hunting in this universe not to arrest but to reunite",
        "the hexclaw looked blatantly like a voidling to me like it grew out of him",
        "i legit dont get scared in horror movies at all but man that scene with the friend smiling on the bed and then her eyes quickly turning into a cars headlights was so unsettling really great scares in that movie i was definitely impressed",
        "curious what the leaks said and what the discussion around them were",
        "because it is an obvious move ambessa would pull the fox and the wolf she knew cait and vi were a thing she literally laid it out \n\na whole i could fill",
        "it literally feels like it was done purely to get her out of the way of caitvi in the easiest possible way",
        "i just dont really get why they made her a spy feels like the writers just wanted another twist but i just dontget what the point of it was to please all the fans who hated her after she slept with caitlyn to show how ambessas been controlling her this whole time or something like genuinely why lol",
        "i too think jinx saving vi scene is a bit underwhleming it could be because viktor and jayce scene is such a climax moment that its all kinda dial down when vi and jinx scene happened",
        "yes viktor is the mage jayce saw as a kid\n\narcane is a multiverse reality and viktor gave jayce as a kid a stone in every possible rune and only the jayce from the reality we see hashas the ability to change viktor",
        "nah mel and jayce had a nice moment in episode  after the fight with viktor him telling her she is no passenger and no force in the world can control her etc\n\njayce and cait on the other hand got nothing if you hadnt watched s you would never know they were basically surrogate siblings lol",
        "yeah that moment when his face splits open during his transformation is metal as fuck so well done",
        "ambessa is dead",
        "thats no random soldier thats the pianist who always was performing at the musicals as always see the councillors attend",
        "completely it absolutely feels like they lost three episodes or a season in the shuffle cause we kept seeing the green guy and loric and then bam dead loric like i dont know anything about these guys other than lorics kinda a bro",
        "westereros",
        "reflecting on the events of s and how s played out they feel like completely different shows most of s feels quaint and inconsequential in comparison",
        "not sure about dying but they both got swallowed up by an anomaly basically erasing themselves from this timeline not sure where they ended up or if they even survived at all but yeah theyre both gone gone lol",
        "jinx is basically the mascot of the franchise not just the show",
        "they did way too much with cait looking over the air vents and smiling and the whole mirroring of the first ship she said shed be on eventually then the jinx glitch stuff safe to say she made it",
        "yordles arent immortal they can be killed if their spirit is killed not sure if the wild rune did that",
        "yeah i was wondering why he didnt converge on the future without hextech maybe hes a vi die hard\n\nedit new thought that particular rune that he gave young jayce the one that was eventually successful was ultimately successful because ekko was able to use it to reverse time maybe the alternate future we saw without hextech unfolded simultaneously and in parallel with the main universethat one also stemmed from the acceleration rune which viktor presumably experimented with only once and so viktor hadnt actually been able to see that world yet in his travels thats why he said thats impossible when he saw the time travel because he thought that the only crystal with that capability was the one in jayces wrist this suggests that viktor was aware that time travel was possiblewhich allowed him to go back and try giving new runes to young jaycebut that he wasnt aware that parallel dimensions existed",
        "thats actually hilarious i thought tiktok brain was an ironic insult but people are really living their life like that",
        "he did so much for the plot",
        "season  happened years ago i totally forgot that part",
        "to be fair i get the vent hint part but you cant really get mad at people for not understanding the blimp part when season  happened years ago and it was some small line that most probably wouldve forgotten unless you rewatched season  before this like i got really confused with the blimp scene being the end but only thought jinx wasnt dead because of the ending font and the vent hints",
        "for real ekko talking jinx out of killing herself with the time thing and having to think of different ways to do it with mere seconds was surprisingly tense",
        "shes not dead they seem to be implying shes alive with the air ducts and the airship that flies away at the end when her psychosis filter comes up",
        "it seems to be heavily implied she isnt dead silcos whole monologue was about the cycle only ends when you find the will to walk away caitlyn smirking over the ducts in the schematic of the hex gate and ending on the ship flying off into the distance with the final jinx written the end we also only see the explosion from far away and vi isnt looking she had the will to walk away she ended the cycle though i dont think the final scene with vi in the hex gate showed that all that well tbh",
        "lets not even mention political implications\n\nshe killed multiple officers and she is responsible for the destruction of the council thus leaving piltover vulnerable for corruption lets not even mention colourful explosions\u00a0\n\nhowever she also became part of zauns cultural identity and played a role in the battle\u00a0\n\npardoning her is going to cause issues on piltover side while punishing her is going to make jinxers bite back",
        "idk really just  more minutes on ep  ep  was perfect with the time it had",
        "for me its everything with the black rose i have no clue what they were about at all maybe its because i dont know shit about league but i feel like that was just shoehorned in there the best thing about arcane was how it doesnt alienate people who dont play lol so it feels weird the black rose was included the way it was",
        "what did she mean by that though like viktor was too consumed by evolution to care",
        "i the final battle was cool but it was so rushed the fight the situation with viktor even the embessa part",
        "season  was one of the best tv you will ever watch season s a good show",
        "the show was easily at its best when it was small scale thats why i absolutely adored episode  seeing all the characters interact with no stakes no tension just living an alternate version of their lives was just perfect \n\nthe action was great but the quality definitely suffered when the pacing picked up this season as a whole couldve used another act at least that said i loved the conclusion to jayce and viktors story",
        "i disagree episode  was near perfect it actually had room to breathe",
        "they are now legends in a league fo their own",
        "pretty much every single leak was right im crying this shits too funny",
        "how the time machine thing exploded when he hit viktor with it",
        "him getting there too late and only rewinding endlessly but only being able to watch her fall and having to let her go  that would have been dark even for this show",
        "i mean his time winder blew up and he was knocked out at that point",
        "theres even a storm in the finale",
        "singed was willing to kill everyone just for his own daughter not a good look",
        "ekko got to keep his world and life\n\nidk man i think he wanted to live in that alternate one where hes with powder",
        "the question is why would he serve them anymore he has what he wants now his daughter has come to life\n\nhis story seems done which i think is a mistake if they want him to continue his little waltz",
        "read that in viktors voice lol",
        "and those are the good ones",
        "unintentional foreshadowing lol",
        "im confused about this help me understand was it another elderly victor from an already doomed timeline visiting other timelines to prevent them from suffering the same fate and he eventually figured out that saving jayce would save the timelines so he saves our younger jayce so he would go onto save our present victor from making the huge mistake presumably he also saved jayce in the timeline where ekko and powder are together because the hextech stuff exploded and killed vi",
        "she also saved cait from a very hard breakup conversation lol",
        "right i can understand why some people feel it was too rushed because quite a few plot threads or details seemed to be set up but didnt go anywhere",
        "and the guy having to drag his body off",
        "his tft ability is tanking projectiles so at least he died doing what he loved",
        "wowowowow the minds on the people that find these things",
        "a lot of the main stuff was mentioned cait eyepatch sex w vi at prison cell vi helps jinx escape jinx and ww fight and die jinx saves vi vik and jayce disappear into the unknown tgt and everyone who read it thought it was ass lol also everyone was praying it wasnt true",
        "love the implication ambessa found a lesbian just in the hope she would seduce cait brilliant writing",
        "i dont even think she spied the whole time personally i think ambessa took advantage of the professional entanglement when maddie was bitter she used caits weakness against her",
        "im not even super invested in the character or anything but it just genuinely ticks me off how lazy and hamfisted it feels it contradicts all of her previous characterisation comes completely out of left field and completely undermines the entire reason the writers stated she was in the last arc as an explicit counter to ambessas influence",
        "probably because jinx being forced to save vi felt a bit forcedmanufactured of a moment the way it went down tbh",
        "wait i thought it meant jayce himself as a character in all realities and not that one jayce in particular",
        "their nice moment isnt romantic when it should have been\n\nthey literally fucked season  and were dating",
        "the irony that the most recent champ is the one to die",
        "he really always played his part to perfection",
        "go far enough west and youll wind up back at easteros again",
        "s felt like an origin story of the core characters  s felt like an origin story of league",
        "i am the arcane writer and viktor is actually living very happy healthy in a different timeline very alive in a cabin with cats im declaring it canon",
        "thats why people like me simply rewatch the whole show before going into a new season lol",
        "im a league player and we dont know either \n\nedit not a league player anymore",
        "yeah i understood it as acknowledgement that he was signing off on the last of his humanity",
        "for me it just felt like how it always has been viktor never really cared about sky not until she was eaten by the arcane",
        "there was sooo much happening i really wished they had paced it slower idk",
        "my issue with the final fight is that it also made little sense and the early parts mainly happened for drama with timings being very plot convinient why did the zaunites show up late why were all of victors puppets away until after the zaunites saved the day what the heck was the point of the whole maddie thing\n\nnot to mention the buildup pretty much sweeping the main driving force of the previous  arcs zaun vs piltover entirely  under the rug like except for the strategy meeting where jayce basically said fuck zaun we aint bother defending it and then the zaun leaders predictably walked out although them even being there is surprising we had nothing about that topic in the last arc",
        "there were parts of this season that easily matched season  they were just fewer and further between",
        "from caitlyn looking at the sides of the hexgate where a person could reasonably hide her holding the monkey head and the distortion at the end its hinted that jinx might have survived a core thing about jinx this season is that shes never able to die properly",
        "you think he can live with himself for stealing the life of another him",
        "idk if this is lol lore but how did his daughter actually back to life i was so confused when i saw her appear",
        "so i think yes he was trying to save multiple timelines and thats why we can see that he kept giving jayce different runes to see which one would actually save the timeline i think but im also a bit confused myself",
        "would be curious to see how they feel after seeing the episode reminds me of tlous leaks where out of context they sounded dreadful but play the game and its delivered in a way where it works and is still emotional",
        "it probably wasnt hard cait is basically a celebrity and the head of a rich family",
        "she doesnt even have to be a lesbian at the end of the day it was all an act her job was to seduce cait",
        "i dont even know if it was her being bitter over vi i think she just fully bought into the noxus strongman propaganda if you rewatch the scene at the end of act  shes one of the first enforcers to take up the chest pounding when ambessa nominates caitlyn to be the general and she seems to have genuine joy in her eyes she really wanted cait to be the figure that ambessa had carefully crafted so when it turned out that she wasnt she aligned herself with noxus\n\nshe tells cait that she appreciated her warmth which is hardly something that you would say to a lover that had betrayed you it sounds very cold and transactional as if she just wanted to get close to caitlyn because she was hot and bright of course i preferred the sweet and naive maddie from act  but i can understand the direction they were coming from even if it wasnt particularly fleshed out",
        "yeah no way warwick just woke up like that when viktor is gone and everything else is dead it just felt so force its like they dont know what to do with jinx and vis closure and said fuck it just get it done",
        "a little late to the party but its implied that viktor meant that jayce in particular because in order to reach that point there were a series of conditions to be met first \n\nfor example the z drive ends up working because ekko uses an inversion of that jayces specific rune acceleration and the z drive explosion is what gives jayce the opportunity to reveal the future to viktor",
        "i think in the grand scheme of their world going to war and living through parallel hell universes and getting abducted by sorceresses their priorities have changed a little",
        "kinda funny",
        "his  scenes in the show truly unmasked his presence",
        "episode  and  are still top shelf",
        "also in se little powder said one day im gonna ride one of those things",
        "i thought she used vis hex crystal to put in her grenade to blow herself and warwick up",
        "in arcane terms all that arcane did a thing on her\n\nhonestly though it was not well explained we just have to infer from the fact that she kinda looks like the evolved beings",
        "my guess is that viktor giving jayce the acceleration rune this time is what made heimerdinger and ekko invent the time manipulation ability that ultimately made the biggest difference in the final timeline\n\nin the timeline where vi dies jayce likely went through with his suicide and viktor died of his illness so hextech never existed and neither does the arcane",
        "a lesbian in arcane bah theyre a dime a dozen",
        "i would have personally loved it if they both just survived and maybe we got a little mini scene of ekko talking to jinx or something but i guess that would be too much happiness for arcane lol",
        "i was thinking the same thing plus nobody would be looking for her if everyone thinks shes dead",
        "yeah but for a few frames during the explosion you can see a shimmer light flashing into the side of the hex gate right where a tunnel is later shown to be given that the overall theme of jinx never being able to properly die and the fact that caitlyn herself seems to be investigating jinxes death\n\nplus the airship at the end being the same as the one powder said she would drive in episode one and the jinx distortions for the end card\n\nit seems incredibly likely that jinx survived the attack we already know warwick  heimerdinger arent dead from necrits interview so it makes sense that they would also keep alive one of leagues biggest faces as well",
        "theres multiple easter eggs hinting that she may have survived i hope she returns as our big fat hero one day"

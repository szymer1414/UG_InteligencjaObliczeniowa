Buying a PC for CIV VII? Quick guide,"Hello people. I've seen some people asking this on the sub and there's been frankly a ton of bad info on the posts, so I thought I'd write up a quick list of things to keep in mind.

# Do you even need one?

CIV has never been a hard game to run! Your current PC might be able to do just fine, even if it's old. Remember that CIV VII will also run on the switch. Waiting a bit and testing has never harmed anything.

# Measuring CIV performance

Most games really just care about FPS (frames per second), but for CIV there's two distinct metrics that interest us. FPS is one of them, this affects how smooth everything looks on the screen. Since this is a slow-paced game, most people are completely fine with lower numbers here. Increasing detail and resolution will decrease your fps. The second measure that is more pertinent to CIV is **time between turns**, or essentially how quickly the PC is capable of processing the AI turns. This can have a large impact, especially in the late game as turns get complex.

# Picking components

This hold true whether you're gonna be buying individual components or a whole prebuilt PC, they use the same stuff internally.

**CPU** \- The most important part. It's what processes the game and has the biggest impact on time between turns. Unfortunately, the hierarchy of what's better than the other thing is kind of hard to understand as seeming lower tier items beat higher tiered ones.

One stand out performer here is the AMD X3D line - a series of specifically gaming chips, that have shown especially good performance in other simulation-heavy games (Stellaris, Factorio, Cities:Skylines, Satisfactory, etc.). The 800 tier (e.g. 7800X3D) within any given generation is usually the best here, yes, better than higher numbers (e.g. 7950X3D). Those have more cores, but in a split design, which is a large benefit to video rendering and such, but falls short in gaming. The three to consider, performance descending: 9800X3D, 7800X3D and 5800X3D (5700X3D is virtually the same thing). If you are currently using any Ryzen 1000-5000 generation CPU, you are likely able to directly change to a 5800X3D without switching any other component!

For a more budget pick, I would suggest a Ryzen 7600, or 5600X as the lowest tier for a new machine. As it stands right now, Intel has no really competitive offerings, unless you can find them for extremely good prices. Any i7 past 12th generation is good, but take into account that they need a lot of power, expensive cooling and might need a bios update to ensure they don't burn themselves out due to a factory voltage config error.

**RAM** \- usually has fairly little performance impact unless you run out of it. 16GB is generally enough, 32GB if you like to have a ton of programs running in the background. For the speed, pick 3600MT/s on DDR4 or 6000MT/s on DDR5. CL number as low as possible. Prebuilts usually don't list the speed, but it's not of key importance anyway.

**GPU** \- This is what draws the frames. As mentioned before, how expensive of a GPU you want totally depends on how smooth you'd like the game to be, how many details you want to draw and what the resolution of your monitor is. Realistically, CIV can run on the CPU integrated graphics, but if you want it to look a little nicer you can look for dedicated options. Ryzen 5000 and lower does not have integrated graphics apart from certain specific models!

Nvidia 60 series (e.g. 4060) is a classic pick, but they're fairly expensive for the performance due to the nvidia brand. AMD options like the 7600 (yes, they're numbered the same as AMD CPUs for maximum confusion) tend to be about 10% cheaper for any given performance level, but fall behind in some features that other game like to use (ray tracing, upscaling). This shouldn't be a big factor in CIV though. Even Intel now has great offerings in the GPU market (Arc B580 & B570). Tiers below this are generally pretty bad value, so if you're targeting a lower budget look on the used market instead of buying something like a 3050.

If this PC will be used for more general gaming and not just CIV, you should consider going up a product tier to the \~500$ offerings, which will significantly increase performance and are generally the sweetspot for bang-for-the-buck. But CIV only, you don't generally need this unless your goal is max detail, 4K, 120fps.

Do note that right around the release time of CIV VII, both AMD and nvidia will be releasing brand new high-end GPUs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i3g44m/buying_a_pc_for_civ_vii_quick_guide/,yabucek,1737119808.0

What the actual fuck World Congress?!,"I have 5 nukes, 2 normal nuke and 3 Thermonuclear, I am in the middle of creating another Thermonuclear bomb. I was relieved, thinking this won't be too hard anymore with this many nukes, but just in case I'll get even more uranium source, from Hungary to make even more nukes.

Then suddenly World Congress happens and it gives 2 options, [ALL CIV NUKE IS SET EQUAL TO THIS CIV] or [THIS CIV LOST ALL OF THEIR NUKES]. The 2nd choice, they'll choose me and if they do I lost all of my nukes! The first choice if they choose someone else I also lost all of my nukes because no one else but me build nukes, If I choose myself they'll choose me too and suddenly everyone else get 5 nukes! FOR! FREE!!

I mean I get why they are doing this, it would be sux if you are playing peaceful run and your opponnent have nukes, but still as the one who make nukes all options are bad.

How do I take care of this? I don't want to lose my nukes and I don't want them to get free nukes either...I also only have 58 diplomatic points, just 2 more from 60 to rival their points but no one else want to trade diplomatic point with me T.T

A lot of people seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding of the intent behind Civ VII's civilization/leader design,"I see a lot of posts with people talking about wanting CA to make a perfect 1-to-1 path of civs from era to era, or being sure that this or that DLC will have ""the Celts/the Anglo-Saxons/the British Empire"", or that ""X civ/leader doesn't have a corresponding leader/civ yet but I'm sure they'll get one in the future"".

I think a lot of people seem to misunderstand that going from Rome to Hawai'i to Qing China, or having Hatshepsut lead the Mississipians, is NOT a ""bug"", it's a feature. It's not something that's going to be ""fixed"" in future DLCs so that eventually all leaders have a corresponding civ and all civs have a perfect 1-to-1 path from era to era.

The design philosophy behind Civ VII, from what we've seen so far in interviews from devs, has always been to mix and match leaders and civ combinations and evolution paths, not to have always the perfect ""historically correct"" path.

And if you're expecting otherwise, you are going to be disappointed, because that's not what the devs are going to prioritize in future DLCs. They'll prioritize interesting civs or leaders, not ""filling gaps"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i3f30l/a_lot_of_people_seem_to_have_a_fundamental/,ConspicuousFlower,1737116275.0

Why is anyone surprised?,"Title. But let me first give a disclaimer for all the ""It's 0.02 cents per hour value"" fanboys so they don't get all worked up.

Yes, I know I don't have to buy the game if I don't think it's worth my money. Yes, I know that I don't have to buy the game if I can't afford to either. Yes, I know I can just wait a decade for the game to go on sale. Yes, I also know that this will not make a difference in price or content. Yes, I know I can just buy the base game instead if I think the DLCs are expensive.

I know. I am just gonna be making a point, stating the obvious.

With that, why are people so surprised that Britain was left out of the base game? The game's name is literally Civilization. How are they going to squeeze money out of you if they add all the demanded civilizations to a game called Civilization? It's like making Counter Strike and locking some guns like the Deagle, or the AK behind DLC (botched analogy I know, that game is competitive, but you get my point), the game experience cannot feel complete without it.

This is probably why people are so upset at the prices for the DLCs. Civilization, a game based around civilizations, has the potential for many civilizations to be added, some which are very demanded like Britain, Ottomans, Byzantium. Hell, people made lists of all the civilizations they want to see, there is potential for many.

(https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i1am1j/my_civ_7_dlc_wishlist_civs/, https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1b2ee5l/civilization_vii_dlc_roster_civilization_leader/)

For such a game, to lock every four civilizations and two leader personas behind a $30 DLC is criminal. Say they can add in another good 16 civilizations (4 DLCs) with cosmetic packs (with each DLC having at least 1 popular/demanded civilization), that's a good $120 just to add civilizations with no new mechanics to a game about civilizations, while the base game is $70.

If the civilizations are not demanded for, or significant, these DLCs won't see sales, so ofcourse they are going to be locking some good civilizations behind these. Y'all may be upset but right now the folks at 2K are looking at this subreddit and smiling because they have you where they want you, feeling ""dissapointed"" and feeling that the game is somewhat ""incomplete"" but at the same time ""excited"" by all the new graphics, mechanics, and some of the demanded CIVS enough to still buy it, and later (or now) get the DLCs to complete your experience of the game.

Same goes for the UI and character designs. They're essentially also selling ""cosmetic"" packs which include ""profile customizations"" i.e. new backgrounds for leaders, outfits, fog of war tiles and **other** ""cosmetic bonuses."" I don't know about you, but when I saw the UI when gameplay was first revealed, I legit thought this is what they were using just to test it, you know when a game is being worked on and they just need some form of a working UI to test it. I didn't think it is the final, finished, polished UI. But now that we know apparently that it is, I won't be surprised if they'll be selling reskins for the UI. Don't get me wrong, I think it's A-okay for companies to sell cosmetic packs to get more revenue, but I want the base game to have at least a clean, functional looking UI.

Point being of this wall of text is that 2K is being exploitive. Is the standalone game a good enough bang for your buck? Probably. But if they're employing such practices, it changes my perception of what it is worth. I will just say this, don't buy into the FOMO, the base game is the bait, and they will reel you in with it towards all those DLCs they have lined up for exorbitant prices.",https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i3ewaj/why_is_anyone_surprised/,Alternatiiv,1737115593.0

There are some pacing issues…,"From my first impressions from the livestreams, I worried that Gold and perhaps other currencies like Influence and Food might be too strong.

After the previews, my second impression has changed: Influence has a lot of opportunity cost; science and culture seem relatively well-paced with the respective trees; Towns with their Food and Gold needs nerfing or scaling by Age.

It may seem weird, but Gold to Production in 6 was around 3:1 or 4:1, so Towns turning their Production into Gold at a flat one-for-one seems weak. However, perhaps partially due to Cities being capable of heavily producing Gold as well, it seems like there’s plenty of Gold in abundance.

From VanBradley’s video, it seems somewhat commonplace that you’ll produce enough Gold that’ll leave you with little else to do, or basically not have much of an opportunity cost.

Likewise with Food. While there’s plenty to use it on, I think perhaps either scaling it to age (50/75/100) or nerfing it for Focused Town sending 75% of its Food will give it somewhat a soft malus. This could help lean into how you’d want more Cities as the Ages progress.

Though with the game settings, some of this can be alleviated by changing how long Ages last (or rather how quickly they are progressed).

Perhaps some of this is a bit tricky to not show a clear path for how many Towns and Cities, but I could see this shifting down the line.",https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i3e009/there_are_some_pacing_issues/,eskaver,1737112063.0

When to Jump Ship to VII?,"I've been a Civ-enjoyer since Civ 1, but have too busy to play any games at all, for the last couple of years!

However, I scooped Civ VI and the expansions in sales, over time, for that 'one day', which is now (for a brief period!) - with the new game coming out at full price and with bare-bones civs (assuming a heap of DLCs, later), I'm thinking I should probably stick with VI for a while, to get some value from it.

How long might it be, before it makes sense to sunset VI and transition to Civ VII, in terms of getting my money's-worth?

Maybe I just go nuts on VI for a while, then rip off the band-aid and start fresh on VII?  
or... perhaps it's worth waiting a while for more civs, some bug fixes, and discounted prices to appear, and just getting more out of VI, in the meantime?

Just curious on some opinions...

My 2 cents (or rather pence) on the whole British situation (CIV VII),"Soooo, full disclosure, I'm French and I have had my fun with this whole drama over the past days but it is time to be serious and pragmatic so if you'll humour me, I'll share my thoughts on why the British Empire wasn't suited for the base game / release build.

Before I go any further, I'm not going to debate whether it should have been included instead of being made DLC because that'd mean discussing the whole DLC structure of modern games and this is not today's topic.

This is more about looking at it from a gameplay perspective.

Another thing, I'm definitely going to mention a few things I've seen mentioned by other users already and I'm not trying to pass those as my original thoughts, I mention them because I happen to agree with their reasoning, however we'll build up to my ""original thought"".

So first of all, as I'm sure you all more or less know, the history of the British empire is a messy hot mess, in comparison the French and Spanish empires are far more ""straight forward /streamlined"" so when translating that into a game like CIV, and because they do their best to strike that balance between gameplay and historical accuracy, some concessions must be made.

Indeed, the British empire, to name a few, could mean Australia, Scotland, Ireland, NZ, Canada etc... and of course the almighty US of A.

As such, CIV 6 had some of the aforementioned nations as standalone civ in the roster but with the way CIV 7 works in terms of Civ/leaders, you can now see how messy this is all getting. Doesn't mean it's an impossible equation, just one that's harder to solve when factoring everything important to Firaxis.

Speaking of them, as pointed out by many, it is a USAsian studio, as such, it's only fair and to be expected they have a bias towards their own country's representation and I think we must all accept that, and I'm sure most of us can.

Ok so now we're entering the ""my original thought"" part:

CIV 7 brings a lot of changes and new concept/mechanic and I want to bring your attention to the exploration age specifically.

Indeed, with the game, as it is currently, segmented in 3 eras, the antiquity and modern eras seem to play roughly ""as usual"" whereas the exploration one is quite funky in comparison:

They made it so that ""the rest of the map"" unlocks for us players to explore and settle on, there is the whole fleet boats to bring back to the ""home empire"", the fact that the seas damage boats to emulate the idea that crossing the seas back then was a dangerous affair etc...

and as such, I think that because there is a lot of new things to get accustomed to, they wanted players to ease into it as much as possible, and to that effect, it feels to me that they chose the Spanish empire as ""poster child"" for this new concept. Again, as mentioned in my intro, the Spanish empire, compared to the British one, is a much more streamlined story: simplified: they crossed the Atlantic, settled in South America and brought all the gold back to Madrid.

This is reflected in Isabella's kit.

Now, about France, well, again, because clichés (and gameplay balance) it's either a focus on culture or war on the home continent (looking at you Napoleon).

As for Lafayette, he's a bit of a wild card, it seems to me that he's taking up Eleanor of Aquitaine dual-leader mantle (not in terms of gameplay but in terms of symbolic) and since Lafayette is tied to both France and America, well he's got a lot on his plate.

Now if we look back at CIV 6, every single leader that led the British empire had bonus in their kits that affected the whole ""home continent vs foreign continent"" mechanics, and we can see that these mechanics are back in CIV 7, but again, I think that Isabella/Spain is whom they picked to showcase the CIV 7 revamped take on them.

To conclude, I, like many others, cannot believe that the British will not be represented in the game in a way or another however for all the reasons mentioned above, I feel like they needed more time or space to properly include them in game, especially as you have to consider the 3 eras, how to spread their bonuses properly (in terms of gameplay and historical accuracy) and avoid a sense of ""too similar to another civ/leader"" but off the top of my head, I could absolutely picture the British civ/leader having bonuses such as ""their boats don't take as much damage when exploring"" as well as many other bonuses relating to settling on foreign land etc...

Also, as France, who are we going to beat up, beefing with the English is kind of our historical raison d'être, innit?

Full roster Civ 7 civilization and leader list gave me a weird Deja vu of paradox experience,"As all the civilizations and leaders revealed, I saw many talking about the absence of the British, but it doesn’t surprise me as I predicted it would happen when Catherine was revealed. I have a blur memory that Catherine and Frederick were leaked a few weeks ago in text somewhere online though I forgot where.

What really shocks me was that among all the promised leaders, many of whom are just outright personas and many civilizations have yet to get a leader representation so far. If Firaxis decides to make a leader DLC for every single civilization for every single age, coupling with dozens of personas, the total number of potential leaders may even exceed 100.

And they can always add more leaderless civ DLC followed by a leader DLC or a civless leader DLC followed by a civ DLC. Not very sure how long it would last.

This reminds me of past Paradox game play experience, when the base game was certainly not in a completed form but just a groundwork for future development. I almost bought the whole set, and it was the most expensive game I ever bought.

Perhaps what the impression of Civ 7 gave me is not only Deja vu but also PTSD from past Paradox purchase experience.

Note: I quit Paradox games long ago, and for the last few years I only purchased their base games just to see how the games look like which never motivated me to buy a full set again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i3b9qn/full_roster_civ_7_civilization_and_leader_list/,Scared-Alps-8399,1737099609.0

Does the Southern Hemisphere just not exist to Firaxis?,"Like I get it, a NA based developer is going to be heavily influenced to care about the history of NA and Europe, like most strategy games based around nation building. I just feel like the whole concept of all these extra Leaders and Civs that transition through the ages would have allowed for more variety, not less.

But I have to say, as someone from Australia, I'm a little bit disappointed. Obviously the introduction of Civs based on Eras allows for more niche or interesting Civs to be added to the game, but it really feels like the Southern Hemisphere is being paid dust, as per usual.

There's only 3 Civs in the southern hemisphere, none of which are Antiquity Era and there's only one Leader for the entire bottom half of the world.

Like America alone has 3 Leaders and 5 (arguably 6) Civs relevant to their history. Which again, I'm not upset about, US developers obviously would have a keen interest in seeing their own history come to life. I'm just using it as an example.

I know there's gonna be plenty of DLC in the future, but I guess I'm just a little bit miffed that this is a common theme across every CIV release.

EDIT: Also to not be biased, it's not even specifically Australia, it's just that there's literally 3 and a half continents with basically barely any representation in a game about civilizations in the entire world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i3b1zo/does_the_southern_hemisphere_just_not_exist_to/,King_Beryl,1737098619.0

The lack of real “historical” paths is a more glaring issue,"I guess people will make do with the obviously lackluster civ roster at release eventually because it has always been like that. But here is a more glaring issue:

First of all I (1) strongly support the concept of ages and civ transitions (2) believe the reason Humankind does not do well is NOT civ transitions, but a poor implementation of it. My hope has been Civ 7 will definitely do it better. As the paths they showed (like Roman-Norman-French, Maurya-Chola-Mughals) are quite promising, I had high hopes and confidence. I admit I was a bit scared by Egyptian-Songhai-Buganda, but they corrected it to Abbasids and I was happy. Also the leaked Han-Ming-Qing also makes a lot of sense. When people disliked the idea because ""you are transitioning from Egypt to China"", I told them don't worry they will have natural paths. You still can play the ""same civ"" just different stages of it.

Well I was wrong. Now it turns out these are the only paths that make sense. Most other civs don't have ""historical paths"". They are all good on their own, but NOT when there is no fitting successor or predecessor in the progression system.

To name a few:
Prussia: of course this is a must have. But who evolve into Prussia? Normans? Normans make sense as a precursor to Britain, modern Italy, and to some degree France and America. But they have little overlap with Prussia. Why there isn't an HRE?

Inca: the closest successor is Mexico, while the many revolutionary states in South America could serve as successors of both Spain and Inca.

Abbasids: they can only evolve into Mughals or Buganda. Neither is remotely related to them. 

Meiji Japan: Ming? Mongols? Hawaii? Neither makes sense. Some are even dangerous.

Buganda: they are actually farther away from Songhai than many people would imagine. 

Shawnee and Missisippi: with all those arguments of ""native Americans evolving into USA is bad"", their closest successor is still USA, then Mexico. It's not that there were no important native North American peoples after 1700s.

I repeat it: the reason why Humankind ""failed"" is NOT because it had civ transition, but because it was done very poorly. It (1) allows you to transition from anyone to anyone (2) changes too fast that you do not feel attached to anyone. I thought Civ 7's system could avoid both but it only fixed the latter. The former is even more exaggerated with fewer options. It seems that instead of curating real historical paths, they consider a region to be properly ""covered"" already as long as it appears in one age, then intentionally choose non-overlapping regions in subsequent ages (except China; for example, a better option for modern Africa is Ethiopia, but it may be avoided because Aksum already covers this region; same with Normans covering Britain). It makes little sense. To make the progression more natural and ""historical"", you actually should choose civs that overlap. Not the other way around.


Hope this would be addressed asap in the first few DLCs. Britain and Mesopotamia aside, the other urgent needs are HRE, feudal Japan, modern Turkey or Arabia, Argentina/Colombia/Brazil, and any modern native American people (e.g. Plains nations).

Ideas for a 4th Age,"Anyone that's had the unfortunate opportunity to listen to me in the past few days or months, has heard me say that I'm anxious about a 4th age. There's a few reasons.

1. I don't think we should switch Civs again. I think that strays too close to Humankind, where people failed to feel that attached to their civ since it changed so much. On another note, I played a Humankind mod that reduces the Civs to 3, and it felt like the Goldilocks zone.
2. (This is just my opinion) The game drags in the last two eras of Civ 5 and Civ 6. Both of these games received more/longer late game eras in the expansions, and I think it ultimately hurt both games. Making too much content post the World Wars era I think is very difficult to make interesting, especially when the eras/age last as long as the other ages.
3. I don't like when half of the game is within the last 200 years irl. I'm biased, because I prefer most other parts of history. Don't get me wrong, I get that a lot of advancements have happened in the last 200 years. I just don't want to spend half of my Civ game on it. I'd prefer closer to 1/3. I also prefer the exploration and expansion in the earlier ages.
4. I think it might be difficult to find enough relevant civilizations from the past 200 years to fill both the Modern Age, and the 4th Age.

I think a 4th Age, or something similar, is inevitable. So here are some ideas that I've come up with that I think might still make it interesting to me.

1. End the 3rd Age with another crisis. World War, pandemic, financial crisis, rebellions resulting in decolonization, etc. I'd like if a World War scenario was toggle-able to occur every time, along with another crisis.
2. Instead of changing Civs, evolve your current civ with ideologies instead. That way Russia can become the Soviet Union, if the player chooses. Prussia can become the German Empire. Or you can go whatever direction suits your fancy/playthrough. Become Communist France if you want. Yes I know it would be a bit late, since World War tech would still be at the end of the Modern Age. Maybe you could ""evolve"" late in the Modern Age, as you prepare for the Final Age. Or we could just keep in mind that it's an alternate history simulator.
3. Push the post WW2 technologies back into the new 4th age. I'll discuss more about why in a later point.
4. Make this last age a shorter one. Maybe 75 turns? Make it a mad dash to the finish. Make every turn count, and hopefully, be interesting. [No Techs that only unlock a military unit or two.](https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/59zw81/the_end_of_the_civ_6_tech_tree_really_sends_a/)
5. Make decolonization a viable strategy. It shouldn't be objectively better, but it should have potential benefits for everyone but the military path.
6. Keep up the victory projects, like the base game. This way the base game's end projects become the first steps of the final age. Some project ideas are below, that I'm not that attached to.

Economic: Complete open border and open trade treaties with x% of the world's nations. Certain projects or actions can force these. Have x% of the world's gold per turn, or something. Create the World Bank, World Currency, World Stock Exchange, etc. Ability to use money to force civs to capitulate in certain ways.

Science: The usual. SPACE. THE FINAL FRONTIER. ~~These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.~~ Actually, can building the Enterprise be the last project lmao? Probably too advanced...

Military: Projects based on nuclear weapons, Bioweapons, Technological weapons, Space weapons.

Culture: I've got nuthin past the World's Fair. Develop the world's preeminent blue jeans brand? Build Disney World? Or should that be economic lol. I'd love ideas.

What 8 Civs with be in the deluxe and founders content packs?,"What Civs will be in the deluxe and founders DLCs?

Now that we know all of the Civs in the base game (which doesn’t include some classic Civs such as Britain etc, as of yet), what do you think the next 8 Civs from the first two DLCs will be? Because Shawnee is an 11th exploration Civ, I think there will be 3 more for antiquity, 2 for exploration and 3 for Modern.

Here are a couple of possibilities:

Antiquity:
Celts/Gaul,
Scythians/Huns,
Phoenicia/Carthage

 Exploration:
Franks/holy Roman Empire (because of Charlemagne),
Florence (because of Machiavelli)

(See image). Apologies if this has already been discussed somewhere, but I noticed this button at the end of a streamer's video after he had reached the end of the Antiquity Age. Is this what I think it is: the glorious return of that little map timelapse thing we got in Civ 5 (and was modded into Civ 6)? Can anyone confirm? I really hope it is, and if so I really hope we can save the results somewhere.

Confidence in the AI,"On a more positive note for today’s events, I’d like to express how confident I am that the AI can achieve its goal, at least better at launch than previous titles.

Why? It comes down to three things:

(1) Projects, (2) Automation and Simplicity.

For me, the main markers of good Civ AI is if it can win and how good is it at preventing me from winning.

(1) Projects. 

Victory comes down to projects and the AI has been good as this previously whether they are doing aid requests or other city projects. Nothing nebulous likely accruing and depleting tourists.


(2) Automation and Simplicity.

Many of the Legacy Paths have something that will get done with less input. Treasure Fleets and Factory Resources auto-generate. Relics come when a foreign city is converted. AI was always going to build Wonders. Adjacencies aren’t a simple as I thought they’d be, but from the previews, I think there will be a lot less low quality districts.

Diplomacy is a very good system that seems like it’ll be a useful way for the AI to push back against the Player without engaging in warfare.

Now, my only uncertainty is how the AI manages in warfare. But my early impressions have been that they are…well, ok. A lot of combat stuff has been streamlined, though there’s a lot of complexity, but that just might work.

What are your thoughts and concerns regarding the AI? I haven’t watched all the content, so I’m sure there are decent stories to tell as well as your own impressions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i2zf7n/confidence_in_the_ai/,eskaver,1737061720.0

1) Any Mesopotamian civ 
2) Ottomans or Byzantines

Petition to Add the Ability to Change City Names in Base Game or First Patch,"Dear Firaxis,

From what I've seen on YouTube videos so far, **you are not able to rename cities** in the game; given that civ 6 didn't have this feature at launch I was afraid this would happen again, especially since in 7 you switch civs I was hoping you could manually update names to reflect the change in civ (i.e. ""Londonium"" -> ""Lunden"").

I know we are 3 weeks out and probably the game has shipped physical copies to implement any kind of real change is improbable rn, but **can we at least get a commitment that this feature will be added in the first patch like civ 6**? So long as this is on the radar and not lost to technical debt I'll be happy.

"I was excited for Civ VII... Not anymore, not hotseat‽‽‽","My fiance & I were very excited for Civ VII, I introduced her to Civ with Civ V and she fell in love with it. Since then we have spent far too many hours playing Civ games together. 1v1, teams, huge open games, you name it we've done it, and me and her often play on hotseat. 

We have 1 laptop, which is an old workhorse of a laptop at this point, so we play hotseat games. Which takes me back to playing with my friends who showed me Civ, we'd all sit around and play hotseat. You get the trash talking, the chit chat, it's a great way to play the game, and a great way to get new people into Civ.

The laptop will not run Civ VII at all🤣 but we are fortunate enough to have ended up with a PS5, so we thought we would run Civ VII on that, plug in the mice and away we go! Only today I find out that won't work as hotseat is gone...

What actually makes me angry about it is that this clearly isn't a game development decision but a purely financial one to force people to buy multiple copies. 

Thanks Bethesda, it all started with you🤣

Jokes & aside, does anyone else think this is just an all round terrible move? It seems like a feature that it takes effort to exclude.

P.S. I know this has probably been brought up already but I only just found this out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i2ybgs/i_was_excited_for_civ_vii_not_anymore_not_hotseat/,AutobotJessa,1737058864.0

My hot take on the ages system,"Arguing in favor of it, there are no civilizations that have existed from the start of human history until the present day. China has had a good run but it's not the same government there's been a succession of dynasties occupying the same territory. And there's not really a mechanism in civilization to account for empires breaking up into constituent nationalities. 

All that being said, when you have a classic game you don't want to change the formula sufficiently that it's no longer the same game. Civ is civ because it feels like civ and isn't a different 4x game. 

The ages thing seems like it's changing the play mechanics too much so they they are losing the flavor of what makes civ what it is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i2x3rw/my_hot_take_on_the_ages_system/,jollyreaper2112,1737055783.0

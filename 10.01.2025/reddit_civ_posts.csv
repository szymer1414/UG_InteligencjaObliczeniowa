Question re cities and towns,"If you have one city and ten town in Civ 7, obviously, all ten towns feed into that one city.

But then you turn one of those ten towns into a second city.  What happens?  Do you have control over which of the nine towns feed into which city?  Is the support of the remaining towns simply split 50-50 between the two cities?  Does each town feed into the nearest city?

In practice, I think this is going to matter a lot.  And so it is going to impact whether the upper hand goes to civs that favor many cities or many towns.",https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i2a6rf/question_re_cities_and_towns/,SheltiePower,1736981444.0

Maybe Catherine isn’t the best choice?,"It may be hard to go against the tide with so many Civ fans cheering on the announcement of Catherine, but there are some important points to make here I think. Please bear with me as I will try to start this from a bit far away. TLDR is down below, but please read the entire thing before adding to the discussion.

I do understand that Civ is a game about empires, colonization, exploitation and all of that stuff, almost every single leader is bound to be problematic in some way. Nonetheless, we usually accept their inclusion in the game, even despite a couple of back-and-forths within the community on whether a particular leader was significant enough for their nation.

Then we play as those leaders, and so we make up cute little scenarios in our heads about all the terrible things we would do to the subjects of our enemies as, say, Ghengis Khan or Shaka. It’s fun, even though historically these people have done horrible, horrible things to others. We’re alright with playing as and even associating ourselves with them for the period of a civ game.

That, however, works up until a certain point. Not all bloodthirsty tyrants are fun to play as. When we entertain the idea of playing as a certain Austrian painter, for example, it becomes clear that even in the realm of game violence we have some taboos and lines we don’t want to cross.

I will make a wild guess and say that one of those lines is the level of ridiculousness of a leader’s violence projected onto the modern world. It’s unfathomable that someone would get a bunch of horses and go on a murderous world tour out of pure powerlust. But rounding people up solely because of their ethnicity and destroying them? That’s messed up, and unfortunately very much imaginable today.

So, Catherine, unfortunately, did just that. Among her countless victories against other empires and notable achievements in reforming Russia, she’s abolished the Hetmanate and Zaporozhian Sich. She made efforts to russify Ukrainians, made Russian the administrative language, sent in Russian settlers to colonize, as well as appropriated the entire Ukrainian culture as part of a broader, village-esque Russian culture, effectively downplaying and destroying it. She introduced serfdom into Ukraine, and while Russians would make each other into serfs as well, that doesn’t help the fact that Ukrainians were mostly living as free peasants for centuries, and that is, no matter how you look at it, enslavement of a foreign people. She effectively abolished the Ukrainian Orthodox church and closed down Ukrainian educational institutions. And most improtantly, she was making huge efforts into destroying the OG kossackhood, which makes the inclusion of cossacks as Russia’s unique unit an extra spit in the face. The Russian unique unit been a hot topic for years, mostly just because it’s been painfully unoriginal and repetitive, but on top of that it’s historically questionable.

You probably know why I’m bringing all this up. I’m a Russian myself, with most of my family living in the city of Mykolaiv — a settlement in Ukraine founded by Catherine and settled by Russians. If I would sit my cousins down to play Civ as Catherine’s Russia, and they would see that they could create a Russian “Cossack” unit and found a city called “Nikolaieff” as showcased in the trailer, they would cuss this game and me out. It’s historical, yes, but in the modern world, it’s painfully divisive.

So, is it really so that Firaxis couldn’t put more careful thought into bringing forth some other Russian leader to play as? Ivan the Terrible for example? Tyrant, but quirky. Russia could be an exploration age civ, with Oprichniki unique unit and a fun, violent, charismatic leader. Russia could remain a modern age civ with Alexander II who abolished serfdom and introduced universal military service instead of the former class-based conscription service. Hell, why not introduce a new civ, Kievan Rus with the vengeful girlboss Olga of Kyiv? That civ could later evolve into Zaporozhian Sich or Russia — all the Eastern Slavs would feel included, Russians, Ukrainians, Belarussians. We’re taking so much liberty in the new Civ installment with combining leaders with different civs. It’s so sad to see that the developers decided to take the unoriginal and, at the current point of history, controversial approach.

I know we’re all nostalgic for the baddie Civ 5 Catherine. To a Western player this post might seem to come out of nowhere and trigger a “but everything was fine nobody complained before” type of reaction. And yeah, things were much more relaxed in the real world before. But history shifts, and as I’ve said above, the question of whether a civ tyrant leader feels right is in part a question of how ridiculous and unimaginable their atrocities are nowadays. It would be so fitting to pass on her for at least this installment.

Catherine’s atrocities are not just today’s reality, but they are also the foundation on top of which the current war was able to be born out of.



TL;DR: Catherine destroyed Ukrainian culture and statehood, it’s painful and alienating to see her legacy being celebrated in the new Civ installment because of the current events",https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i27x50/maybe_catherine_isnt_the_best_choice/,Similar-Froyo6045,1736975495.0

By Civ 6, I was already familiar with everything that I almost never looked at the civilopedia entries. This year however, the devs made the choice to name a lot of unique units, buildings, traditions .. etc. in native tongues.

I just cheesed my way through the Loyalty mechanic for an easy Domination win...,"Sorry if this is obvious or has already been brought up.

Domination wins were too easy in the original game because you could send a massive army/navy over and just take the capital and then turtle the city up against being taken back. So in the expansions they add this Loyalty mechanic to try to force you to instead methodically take over a civilization through religion, conquest at the border, and clever use of governors and spies, until you can sustainably take and hold a capital city. Take one too early and it will just flip back in under ten turns (I've seen that was said ""Rebellion in 2 turns"" the second I conquered it.)

Here I was yesterday looking at the map. I had conquered three capitals in an eight civ game, and I was strategizing about how I might use the island I sent two settlers to to begin making inroads into the remaining continent with three other civs while picking my way through Australia, which had built an impressive number of cities organically up to that point. I was estimating I could get the game wrapped up in the next 50 or so turns.

It suddenly dawned on me. I had four bombers, three on aircraft carriers and one based about 15 tiles from Canberra, a few ground units stationed here and there around the world, and four nukes.

Turns out you don't have to do what you'd do in an actual sensible real world conquest. Since this is a game, you win by satisfying the rules of the game, and the rules are that you need to hold all other capitals to immediately win. So yeah, you can just nuke all four capitals on the same turn, march a unit into each of them, and instantly ""win,"" even though all four capitals would have revolted.

It went from a two hour plan to a two minute plan pretty quickly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i211j2/i_just_cheesed_my_way_through_the_loyalty/,Res_Novae17,1736957927.0

Civ VII - Logical Civ Progression Through Eras,"I'm looking at a logical progression of Civs though the Eras and I think we can sort of use this to predict what Civs are left in the Modern Era (I believe there is 1?) and what Civs would be coming in expansions (probably early on) as well as some leaders

So here is the map I've come up with

Antiquity: Aksumite / Egyptian
Exploration: Songhai
Modern: Buganda
Leaders: Amina / Hatehepsut

Antiquity: Han
Exploration: Ming / Mongolian
Modern: Qing / Russia (from Mongolian)
Leaders: Confucius + Kublai Khan?

Antiquity: Mauryan
Exploration: Chola
Modern: Mughal
Leaders: Ashoka + it's not CIV without Gandhi

Antiquity: Mayan
Exploration: Incan
Modern: Mexico
Leaders: Pachacuti + Frida Kahlo?

Now here's where things get a bit more interesting...

Antiquity: Khmer
Exploration: Hawaiian / Majapahit
Modern: Meiji (Japan) / Siamese
Leaders: Trung Trac / Himiko

I don't see a way to get to Hawaii with the current civs so I think a path of Maori + Australia / New Zealand could be coming soon? Add in Queen Lili'uokalani as a leader for this path?

Similarly with Japan - this path just feels a bit weird for them so I think we'll see something like Gojosean Korea -> Heian Japan type of thing... This also leads to an Exploration and Modern Korea

From there you have a more natural path of Khmer -> Majapahit -> Siamese with Trung Trac

Antiquity: Mississippian
Exploration: Shawnee
Modern: American
Leaders: Tecumseh

So this one just feels a bit wrong going to America at the modern age so I would personally like to see Navajo or Cherokee get added for a Modern age civ

Antiquity: Persia
Exploration: Abbasid
Modern: ???
Leaders: Xerxes / Ibn Battuta

This one is just weird because I don't see who the Modern civ would be right now which makes me think the last Modern civ will be Saudi Arabia

Antiquity: Greek / Roman
Exploration: Norman / Spanish
Modern: Russia / France / American
Leaders: Augustus / Ben Franklin / Catherine / Charlemagne / Harriet Tubman / Isabella / Lafayette / Machiavelli

... This one isnt tricky persay or needs anything added to it, but let's be real, this is the path they want to use for showing off this new system",https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i1z1t0/civ_vii_logical_civ_progression_through_eras/,Spoonful_Of_PB,1736952683.0

Historic* Guide for Lafayette ,"As we approach launch, it might be interesting to discuss the best “historic” pathways for each leader. Of course, leaders and civilizations are no longer connected and can create wild and wacky synergy, so feel free to share those.

Following this are my thoughts on the “historic” pathways for Lafayette and general thoughts on the Leader.

Overview—

Lafayette strongly favors Military Victory, favors Scientific and Culture Victories, and is decent for the Economic Victory.

AI Interaction—

Lafayette likes the person who’s doing the best a little more and likes the person doing the worst a little less, basically. He’ll largely be a helpful player though you’d be indirectly helping him as well. He’ll be a cultural powerhouse in the Modern Age.

Historic* Pathways—

Greece||Norman||America

This appears to be the best pathway for any American or American-adjacent Leader as Greece can offer the Influence bonuses that allow to bolster the Leader’s skill set. Use the defensive or aggressive bonuses of the Norman civilization to then prepare for an economic and industrial powerhouse in the Modern Age.

Rome||Norman||America

Same as before and above, but this pathway doubles down on culture and military bonuses to expand your empire. Expand thru conquest and then settle in for an Industrial Revolution for the Modern Age.

Greece||Norman||French Empire

See the America pathway for the lead-in. Set yourself for the long haul to weaponize diplomacy against your rivals before crushing them as French Empire.

Rome||Norman||French Empire

See the America pathway for the lead-in. Instead of having an industrial base. You triple down on culture and military conquest, leaning hard into the two victories Lafayette is strongest in.

Help me from Civ Addiction,"Hello Guys,

I have been playing Civ 6 (only Civ that I have played) since my high school days. Now after my undergrad (Eco) & now in postgrad (MBA) I am still playing this game. I don't know what draws me into it. I know all the bloody features of the game, there's nothing for me to explore anymore but still I am addicted till now and wasting hundreds of hours into this.

This things never happen with me with any other media. If I watch a movie or play a game even which I consider masterpices (GTA 5, Cyberpunk 2077, Horizon), I never watch/play them again as I believe there are so much to explore than reexperiencing same things.

When I started, I thought who'd want a cultural diplomatic religious victory? I only cared about science. Now since I discovered that other victories are also fun, I can't stop again. I am again now addicted to Civ.

I can do so much during those times. Study for Professional Certifications, Do Internships, Improve CV yet I am unable to.

What happens if the same continues during my job? 

Until now it has never impacted my study/career but what if!?

"Practicing PvP, I need some advices","I think I’m new to CIV, maybe around 300 hours, I’m not even try every civ yet, just spend time with some that I’m familiar with like Egypt, Aztec, Japan, Germany and Vietnam... I think I’m still such at this game because the whole time I spent was to find out optimal path, or nuke the AI…

Recently I feel AI is so boring. I just have to focus or rush on one thing to win them (like science + production or religion, or culture, or just build army and kill kill kill…) - and decide to practice PvP, start with tiny pangaea map, duel, and it’s ridiculously fun, like I never ever known how to play this game (a Japan scout jump down from some hill steal Aztec’s settle totally prevent Aztec from snowball, while Vietnam guerilla archer play hide and seek in forest…) - these factor I never have met before vs AI.

Where can I learn more about strategy PvP of this game? I try to search youtube, there are very little video about PvP (not much people have time together, and if they do, they don’t have time to record it too, I guess).

I also have some question about this topic:

1 - I tried around 50 duel game with my friend, and I feel that start location affect the game so much, it’s not balanced. 2 good players with no mistake can tell the outcome after 40 turn (standard speed), for example, when Artec find Paititi and start spam his Eagle Warrior with gold, no defense can stop them… Yes, that’s lucky, but isn’t that the game map unbalance?

2 - I read a lot of guides/articles suggest about first trained unit usually a scout, I AGREE (after see the player use scout to steal another settle). However, in some game, when there are 2 barb camp near base, 2 SLINGERS are better as they can travel map safer/further, clear barb camp, and later, defend city. I also see some player don’t build scout or slinger first, they do… monuments. So, what is your first build? How many scout do you usually have during early game?",https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i1vab7/practicing_pvp_i_need_some_advices/,Our-Friend-Lulu,1736940061.0

La Fayette model inspiration,"[La Fayette in Civilization VII](https://preview.redd.it/jwjfr7e9s4de1.jpg?width=854&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6431ca27ac5e71d65a5cb42847b577dd1fb8cfdc)

Interestingly, Firaxis took heavy inspiration from two portraits to create a chimera La Fayette. The first one is close to home (for them): a portrait by an American painter. It shows young La Fayette during the American Independence War, of which at least two copies exist. From this, Civ VII La Fayette's face is clearly inspired, despite small differences. I can't find any other portrait of La Fayette without a wig before his later career in the post-Napoleon monarchies.

[Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert Motier, Marquis De Lafayette, oil on canvas painting by Charles Wilson Peale, 1779-1780.](https://preview.redd.it/3it21wtps4de1.jpg?width=713&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69f2b97c2450b2dde1b6a24ed22256d4339c43bd)

The costume, though is different. This high-collar golden-buttoned uniform with this glorious white tie is directly taken from a 1834 painting representing La Fayette during the French Revolution, when he was lieutenant-general in 1791, at the time of the brief constitutional monarchy.

[Lafayette as a lieutenant general in 1791, by Joseph-Désiré Court \(1834\)](https://preview.redd.it/bgbibrr6u4de1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2a637fa38969bc93944ea1d0470978c21ed782bc)

Very interestingly, when you check his Wikipedia page, the first portrait heads the English-language one while the second one heads the French-language one. To each their own La Fayette! This is kind of why I made this little research: as a French, I didn't know how young wigless La Fayette looked like and from where Firaxis took their inspiration.",https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i1udau/la_fayette_model_inspiration/,Pastoru,1736936015.0

Except the other guys may just be further away, just having a better age than mine, and not to mention the very hurdle of building Theater Squares and getting GWAM in the first place, in the latter case, you are either already beaten at or in heated ompetition with some other Civs for them.

Great works aside, AI seemed to have a better time making existing cities loyal compared to newer ones, CMIIW, so that's another issue.

Civ Theory Crafting and Exciting Paths,"With Civ 7 being very close to release, I can't help but theory craft out a few paths for future games. If you don't want to read mine and just want to throw yours in the comments, that's fine! I want to know what other people are cooking up. And yes I know the game isn't out yet. I'm just an insane person that needs to think about this crap weeks ahead of time.

Isabella | Egypt -> Spain -> Mexico

This is the path I want to roll first. General strategy is to build up a small number of strong cities in antiquity with Egypt. This allows you to bring extra settlement limit into the exploration age and settle a ton of cities in the new world with Spain. Ideally aiming these new settlements for navigable rivers to have them grow faster with Egyptian traditions. I'm also very interested in Mexico's abilities and just want to play them :)

Amina | Mississippi -> Shawnee -> America

I don't think that this path is officially confirmed, but is how I'm guessing the path will work out to be. Mississippi and America are both big economic civs with big bonuses to resources. This works well with Amina to give even more gold on top. Shawnee is sort of an awkward middle child, but still aren't slouches and are necessary(?) to link Mississippi to America.

Augustus | China x3

I think the China line allows Caesar to lean into his empire building sensibilities instead of his usual conquesting warmonger vibe. Antiquity China supports an aggressive expansion strategy without necessarily conquesting for it. Further, Exploration and Modern China give bonuses to towns and support big capitals just like Caesar wants.

Ibn Battuta | China -> Abbasid -> Flexible

This is entirely based on the assumption that Battuta is connected to Abbasids. I think the Abbasids look like a really cool civ and I think the best way to set up the Abbasids is China. Abbasids want many large cities and China's growth event ability lets that happen better than any other antiquity civ (imo). Khmer is a close second, but it seems Khmer is much better at building one huge capital, which I don't think will be the best for strategy for the Abbasids. Both Khmer and China also bring strong traditions into what will be a science focused Abbasids.

Lafayette | Greece -> Spain -> Mexico

This is built off the back of my thought that Mexico is the perfect civ for Lafayette. Mexico is all about slotting Traditions into government which is Lafayette's whole deal. Mexico also supports a Domination or Culture victory, which is also what you want to do with Lafayette. You could switch out Greece for Rome, but I like the influence you get from Greece to support spamming that unique endeavor of yours.

Tecumseh | Greece -> Flexible

Tecumseh and Greece seems very very good paired together. Tecumseh and Greece BOTH have the ability to get combat strength for each city state you are suzerain of. This on top of hoplites and their combat strength buff, plus the greek tradition that gives your commanders XP bonus. This stacks up to be a unique and very strong domination civ if your able to grab ahold of a few city states. You don't have to roll domination with this pairing, but that reads as the more interesting option for me personally.

Trung Trac | Rome  -> Flexible

This pairing is on the basis that Trung Trac gets a bunch of promotions on their first commander, and Rome has a unique commander that can settle cities when you get enough promotions. Perfect. Simple. Could be a fun snowball antiquity strategy.

Xerxes The Achaemenid | Mississippi -> Shawnee -> Flexible OR China -> China -> Flexible  

Lastly, but not Leastly. This is the Xerxes persona that gets bonus gold and culture on unique buildings and unique improvements. I assume that improvements are better to shoot for since you can build more improvements than you can build buildings. Both of the above paths have unique improvements, but with different ways of going about it. Mississippi and Shawnee have improvements that give food, so its easier to justify building a ton of them without missing out on growth. The China path, however, leans fully into giga culture and giga gold yields. These improvements are probably better to stack on towns as building many of them in cities could lead to some very small cities. I think there are a lot of different ways to play this persona as another angle to shoot for is to go for big yields on buildings in the Exploration age and get an easy science golden age.",https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i1l32f/civ_theory_crafting_and_exciting_paths/,GoodPilot451,1736901223.0

I asked myself this because Augustus was obviously associated with Antiquity and Rome, and so he very well could have had only a scenario here and I wouldn't have been surprised. However, in one of the pictures in the Dev Diary, we can see that Amina has 6 achievements for growing her legend, with them being the two choices for each Ages.

How Pricing Works,"There's a lot of discussion about pricing, but I don't think people really understand how pricing tends to work out there.

This is generally how pricing works in pretty much any industry.

Civ VII is going to have sales and profit targets, and a forecast to match those. That forecast is how much they expect to sell and how much they expect to spend.

Whether those targets are greedy is tough for us to know. But as someone who has done a lot of pricing, they are probably pretty high, at least on the revenue side.

Why? Because Civ VII is a pretty sure thing and on a company wide basis, sure things tend to have to support riskier ventures. Everyone who buys a popular video games is almost certainly subsidizing failed ones in one way or another.

One you have your revenue requirements, you build that revenue plan. The important thing here is that the target isn't changing (as long as your costs stay the same).

So you devise a revenue model to hit that number. 

There's a bunch of models. One is a game with no special editions and no DLC, but keep in mind you have to hit that number.

That version of the pricing model almost certainly has a base price higher than $70. It's also a pricing model that might not even get to your target because it is fundamentally inefficient to basically only offer one product for one price.

The variable pricing model Civ VII has is smarter for them but it also likely means if you want to wait or don't want everything, you are likely paying less.

By offering a $130 option that is targeted at completists, hardcores, or people with a lot of money, they are creating something that people will pay more for because they value immediate access or completism or don't value money.

Are they getting value for that extra $60? From most people's point of view, they are not. That's the point. From theirs, they are. 

And guess what, that extra revenue means that they can offer a slightly lesser version of Civ VII for you at $70 rather than $80 or $90. 

And it means that a year from now, they can offer a sale to you at a much more discounted price. Because they've gotten the hardcores to pay more.

If anything, the people getting screwed are those who actually pony up. But you notice that they don't care. Because the value equation is different.

Is this greedy? YMMV, but for me that comes down more to the overall target. I don't know if their target is unreasonably high; I don't know their cost structure. I don't know the risk elements. 

What I would say is that this model is not inherently greedy without knowing that. It's smart. I think it actually creates a situation where the game is available for cheaper for people who don't value those extra leaders.

And it milks idiots like me who want to play day one to fund it. Please note that this is basically true EVERYWHERE. The premium model is almost always a higher profit margin and meant to target people who value different things or things differently. Cars. Airplane Tickets, etc. 

Finance Geek Note:  Later DLC and add-ons are likely done on a separate model with separate expectations based on user base, etc. Evaluated individually. They may include an option value in the base evaluation for this cash flow that supplements the revenue; they may not.

TLDR:  Pricing decisions aren't made one by one for these immediate things. It's all part of a larger revenue model and if they didn't do the planned DLC, they'd either need to cut that content or raise the base price. That doesn't mean they aren't greedy; the profit expectations may be sky high. But the model isn't inherently greedy. People gotta get paid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i1dfyj/how_pricing_works/,gogorath,1736880988.0

Civ Unlocks,"u/sar_firaxis mentioned yesterday that every civ will have either a resource or gameplay unlock. I'm not sure if ""gameplay"" unlock just refers to the leader and historical paths we've already encountered or something different, so I'll leave that speculation to others. But it occurred to me (I may be slow) that a big hint about what those resource unlocks will be can probably be gleaned from a civ's start bias. The only resource unlock we know about so far is horses -> Mongolia, and sure enough Mongolia has a horse start bias. What about the other civs?  

In the Exploration Age, the civs with resource start biases are:  

Abbasid - camels

Majapahit - spices

Ming China - silk

Mongolia - horses

Normans - iron

Chola, Hawai'i, Inca, Shawnee, Songhai, and Spain all just have terrain biases.  

In the Modern Age so far:  

France - wine

Russia - furs

And there's America, Mexico, and Qing China with just terrain biases.  

So, roughly half have potential resource unlocks. Of the remaining modern civs, do any stand out as being tied to a resource?  

Mughal - saltpeter/niter?

Siam - ivory/elephants?

Buganda - ?

Meiji Japan - ?

Germany - ?

Question about Beyond the Sword expansion for Civ4,"Is it possible to play an earlier version of the game? I need version 3.17, but I found only individual patches, which, if installed on the game with a later version (3.19), of course, will not lead to any result. If this is possible, where can I download it? I would be very grateful for your help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i19vxm/question_about_beyond_the_sword_expansion_for_civ4/,DueUse140,1736872012.0
Historic* Guide for Tecumseh,"As we approach launch, it might be interesting to discuss the best “historic” (how many asterisk and quote marks can I do for this) pathways for each leader. Of course, leaders and civilizations are no longer connected and can create wild and wacky synergies, so feel free to share those.

Following this are my thoughts on the “historic” pathways for Tecumseh and general thoughts on the Leader.

Overview—

Tecumseh favors Military Victory, but is decent at Scientific Victory.

AI Interaction—

Tecumseh will be a bit fickle. There are hostile Independent Powers and non-hostile ones, so you might get on his bad side if you go too far and clear the hostile powers. He’s likely to have a mid/late-Age burst of strength, but nothing too notable, imo.

Historic* Pathways—

Mississippian||Shawnee||America
Acquire resources as the Mississipian Civ and build on trade for Gold and Happiness. Transition into Shawnee and double down on the Food, Production and Gold resources bring. Use your Influence in this Age to exert pressure on Independent Power control and your region. As America, you double down on Influence and Gold and power your way to an Economic Victory.

Greece||Shawnee||America

This American pathway begins with Greece to take advantage of the additional Influence generation and efficiency when taking diplomatic action. The trade off is Influence over additional boons to resource accumulation, like Food, Production, Gold and Happiness.

Rome||Shawnee||America

Same as above, but with Rome, Tecumseh can lean in becoming a strong military power towards the end of Antiquity. Then, using the centralized focus of Rome, the transition into Shawnee can focus on using the strong Capital to emerge in Exploration with fervor.

Bonus Pathway—

Mississippian||Shawnee||Mexico

This is a pathway the AI can take and one that one might take to avoid Tecumseh and Shawnee heading into America. One could see this as Tecumseh joining with New Spain in their fight for independence and against the colonial powers. Thus, Tecumseh leads a civilization that strives to be its own with a strong heritage and diverse way to achieve victory.

Leader vs Civ starting biases in Civ 7,"If you're playing as Catherine and pick Khmer or Maya as your starting civ, how would the game compute a shared starting bias between tundra (Catherine) and tropical (Khmer/Maya)? Would the game just pick one of the two at random, would it always default to either the leader or civ, or would it create an absolutely insane map generation? I kind of hope it's the latter just for the fun. I doubt the devs have answered this question yet so mostly just asking for speculation and fun discussion.

Leaders with unique units?,"That's a great idea in Civ 6 but we haven't got any leader UUs in Civ 7 so far. Maybe they could come in the future.

With the decoupling of leaders and civs, I think it is actually more convenient to separate UUs from the ""ruling class"" and UUs from the ""locals"", which is a common separation in history.

For example, when Alexander and his successors ruled Greece, Perisa and much of the Near East, they also spred the use of pike phalanx and companion cavalry wherever they went. So if Alexander, representing the Hellenistic conquerors, has the phalanx or companion cavalry as the leader UU, he could pair up with many civs, like Greece, Egypt and Persia, to represent the Hellenisitc states. Same with the Roman Empire and their legions. After Celts/Gauls/Britons are introduced to the game, you can pair them with a Roman leader with limitanei as the UU to portray Roman Gaul/Britain.

In fact I also think the Normans should be better represented in this way: they were also mostly ruling military elites but not mass immigrants. After medieval England (taking most of the traits from the current Norman civ but with longbowman as the UU), France and Italian states get properly separared out in the future, they could all pair with a Norman leader (Rollo or William the Conqueror) with the Chevaler UU to depict Norman England, Normandy and Sicily, respectively.

The current system could get some rework with a major DLC or an expansion to accomodate leader UUs. Thoughts?

Are some starts actully unplayable ? ,"Tried my first game on Emperor difficulty. Random civilization(rolled Persia), true earth start, with 10 players. The game is already over on turn 35 because my capital city has stopped growing and producing things. My loyalty kept plummeting and its apparently going to rebel in 3 turns. Was there something I could have done to prevent this or should i reroll the start if im this close to other civs ? Conversely am I over stating that the game is over? It seems like I would be massively behind even if i were to conquer the free city.

Why is there so much misinformation about Civ 7 editions?,"Every single time the Civ 7 editions are brought up on this sub, people start complaining about Day 1 DLCs and critical components being chopped off. Have people actually looked at what the different editions actually contain?

The only leader pack at release is The Tecumseh and Shawnee Pack which is already included with the standard edition as a pre-order bonus.

Both Crossroads of the World Collection and Right to Rule Collection are future post-launch content which are still being developed but you are just paying for it earlier and at a discounted rate as a supporter. These are the packs included with the Deluxe and Founders edition but none of these are critical day 1 DLCs ""chopped off"" from the game. These are just future content packs (again future and not existing in game currently) which have existed since Civ V. Everyone will still have to pay for the eventual expansions.

So the only actual bonus content you get with the DE and FE is fluff content like leader personas and profile customizations. Is this the critical day 1 DLC people are outraged about? 

I absolute do not like day 1 DLC content but this is not it and people being outraged by this seem to be either misinformed or just want something to be mad about which is pretty much the thing everywhere these days.",https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i18fm5/why_is_there_so_much_misinformation_about_civ_7/,skyline385,1736868193.0
